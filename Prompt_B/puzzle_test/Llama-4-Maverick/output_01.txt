1. The side to move is White, as indicated by the 'w' in the FEN notation. The objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The current position is given in FEN: 8/8/8/8/8/6B1/5QN1/5K1k w - - 0 1. This means the position on the board is: White: King on f1, Queen on f2, Knight on g2, Bishop on g3; Black: King on h1.
3. To checkmate Black's king on h1, we need to examine possible checkmate patterns. Given the pieces available, the White Queen and the Bishop on g3 are potentially useful for delivering checkmate.
4. The most promising candidate moves involve using the Queen, potentially with the support of other pieces. Let's examine possible moves:
   - The Queen can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check which of these moves results in checkmate.
   - The Knight on g2 can potentially support the Queen or deliver checkmate itself if it's a check.
5. Let's analyze potential checkmate patterns:
   - To checkmate the Black king on h1, it needs to be in a position where it is in check and cannot escape the check.
   - The White Queen is on f2, and a potential checkmate could involve moving it to a square that puts it in a checking position, potentially supported by other White pieces.
   - One potential checkmate pattern involves Qh4# or similar, but the Queen is not yet on h4. Moving the Queen to h4 is a potential first step, but we need to verify if it's checkmate.
6. Let's examine the move Qh4+, which would put the Queen on h4, checking the Black king. However, we need to verify if it's checkmate.
7. Checking the move: 1. Qh4+ (or more accurately in algebraic notation directly related to the FEN, Qf2-h4+), we see that after 1. Qh4+, Black's king has no legal moves to escape the check because it's on h1 and the Queen is supported by the Bishop on g3. The King cannot capture the Queen because it's protected.
8. Verifying the checkmate condition:
   - The Black king is on h1.
   - The White Queen moves to h4, checking the king.
   - The check is not escapable because the Queen is supported by the Bishop on g3, and there are no other Black pieces to interpose.
9. Therefore, the move 1. Qh4# is checkmate because it puts the Black king in check with no legal moves to escape the check.
