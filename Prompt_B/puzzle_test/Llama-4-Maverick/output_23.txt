1. The side to move is White, as indicated by "w" in the FEN notation. The objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The current position is: r4r1k/p5Rp/1p3pb1/2P4N/2B5/P7/6PP/B2n1nK1 w - - 0 1. 
   Black's king is on h8, and it's White's turn. The most promising candidate moves involve pieces that can potentially attack the Black king or force it into a checkmate. 
   The White pieces that can potentially participate in the attack are: the Knight on h5, the Bishop on c4, the Rook on g7, and potentially the Bishop on a1 if it can be developed or used to support other pieces.
3. Let's analyze the candidate moves:
   - The Knight on h5 is already in an attacking position and can potentially deliver checkmate or support other pieces to do so.
   - The Rook on g7 is also in an aggressive position and can potentially be used to deliver checkmate or support other attacking pieces.
   - The Bishop on c4 can potentially pin or attack Black pieces or support other White pieces.

Let's start with the most promising candidate moves:
1. Nf6 is a potential move as it puts the Knight in a strong position to potentially deliver checkmate or force Black into a difficult position.

Let's analyze: 
1. Nf6 gxf6 (Forced to avoid immediate checkmate or significant material loss)
2. Rg8+ Rxg8
3. Rxg8#

This line appears to be a checkmate in 3.

Let's verify the legality and checkmate:
- 1. Nf6 is legal.
- 1... gxf6 is a reasonable response.
- 2. Rg8+ is legal and puts Black in check.
- 2... Rxg8 is forced to get out of check.
- 3. Rxg8# is legal and checkmates Black.

No earlier checkmate is available in this line.

Let's check if there's any other possible checkmate in 3:
Other moves like 1. Bxd5 or other Knight moves don't seem to lead to a quicker or more forced checkmate.

The chosen line is:
1. Nf6 gxf6
2. Rg8+ Rxg8
3. Rxg8#

[FINAL PGN]
1. Nf6 gxf6 2. Rg8+ Rxg8 3. Rxg8#
