1. The side to move is White, as indicated by "w" in the FEN notation. The objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The current position is given in FEN: 5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1. This means the position is: White King on f6, White Pawn on f7; Black King on f8.
3. To identify promising candidate moves, we look at the White pieces. White has a King on f6 and a Pawn on f7. The Black King is on f8. The most promising candidate moves involve the White Pawn and King, as they are the only White pieces on the board.
4. The White Pawn on f7 is already on the seventh rank and is poised to promote or potentially deliver checkmate. The most straightforward candidate move is to promote the Pawn to a Queen by moving it to f8, which would put the Queen in a position to potentially checkmate the Black King.
5. Let's analyze the candidate move: 1. f8=Q#. If White promotes the Pawn to a Queen on f8, it results in checkmate because the Black King is on f8 and cannot escape the check from the White Queen. The White King on f6 also supports this by controlling the surrounding squares, ensuring the Black King cannot escape.
6. Verifying the move:
   - The move 1. f8=Q# is legal because the Pawn is promoting to a Queen on the opponent's end.
   - It delivers checkmate as the Black King is captured by the newly promoted Queen.
   - There is no earlier checkmate before move 1 because it's White's first move.
7. Since 1. f8=Q# results in checkmate and meets all the criteria, it is the correct move.

[FINAL PGN]
1. f8=Q#
