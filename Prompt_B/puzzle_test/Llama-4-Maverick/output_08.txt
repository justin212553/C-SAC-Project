1. The given FEN is 8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black (b).
   - The White king is the one to be checkmated.

2. The Black pieces are a king (k), a knight (n), and a rook (r). 
   - The Black king is on g7, the knight is on e5, and the rook is on g5.
   - The White pieces include a king (K), a rook (R), and three pawns (P).
   - The White king is on g1, one rook is on f1, and the other rook is potentially on r1 (though the exact position of the second rook isn't directly given, we can infer it's on the first rank and likely on f1 or h1).

3. To checkmate the White king, we need to analyze potential moves:
   - The White king is on g1, so it can potentially be checkmated by a piece putting it in check with no legal moves to escape the check.
   - The Black rook on g5 can potentially move to g1 to checkmate the White king if it were not for the White rook on f1. However, if the Black rook moves to g1, it would be captured by the White rook on f1, but this isn't a checkmate because the White king can move.
   - However, we should consider that the Black pieces can potentially work together to checkmate the White king.

4. Let's analyze potential checkmate patterns:
   - The Black rook can move to g1 (Rg5-g1#), but this is not checkmate because the White rook on f1 can capture it (Rf1xg1). However, if the White king were in check and had no escape, it would be checkmate.
   - Upon closer inspection, we see that 1...Rg1+ is a check, and the White king has no good way to escape the check because Kxg1 is not possible due to the presence of Rf1, but the king can move to h1 or f1. However, if we consider the position, there's a potential checkmate if the Black pieces coordinate correctly.

5. Let's directly examine potential moves:
   - The Black rook can give check on g1. So, Rg1+ is a potential move.
   - Upon further inspection, if Black plays 1...RxR+ (RxRf1+), it forces the White king to a vulnerable position or captures the rook, but the actual checkmate comes from understanding that after 1...Rg1+, the White king's movement is restricted.

6. Let's directly analyze 1...RxRf1+:
   - If 1...Rg1+, then 2. Rxg1, and it's not checkmate.
   - However, the correct checkmate is achieved by 1...Nf3#, as it directly puts the White king in checkmate.

7. Verifying the move:
   - 1...Nf3 is a valid move for Black.
   - It directly checkmates the White king because the knight is putting the king in check and there are no legal moves for the White king to escape the check.

8. Checking for earlier checkmates or alternative moves:
   - There are no other checkmates in one move other than Nf3#.
