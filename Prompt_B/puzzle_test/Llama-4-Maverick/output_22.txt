1. The given FEN is 1k6/1p6/5r2/3q2p1/Qp1P4/4PrPp/2R4P/R5K1 b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black.
   - The White king is to be checkmated.

2. The most promising candidate moves for Black are:
   - Qd8# (if possible)
   - Moving the Black queen to other potentially checking squares
   - Using the Black rooks or other pieces to support the queen or deliver checkmate

Let's analyze the position:
- The Black queen is on d5, and it has potential checking moves.
- The White king is on g1, so we need to get the Black queen or another piece to checkmate it.

First, let's list the pieces and their possible moves:
- Black queen on d5 can move to various squares.
- Black rook on f6 can potentially move to f1 or other squares to check or support checkmate.
- Black rook on f3 is somewhat pinned but can still move along the f-file or potentially to other squares.

Let's examine potential checking moves and supporting moves for Black:
1. The Black queen can potentially check the White king on certain squares.
2. The Black rooks can support the queen or directly check the king.

Let's start with the most promising candidate moves:
1. Qd5-g2+ or Qd5-f3+ (to check the White king directly or indirectly).
2. Rf3-f1+ (to potentially checkmate or force a response).

Let's analyze a potential line:
1... Qd5-g2+ 
   - 2. Rxg2 (forced to get out of check) Rf1#
   - This line checkmates in 2 moves, not 3.

Let's try another line:
1... Rf3-f1+
   - 2. Rxf1 (forced) Qd5-g2#
   - Again, this checkmates in 2 moves.

To achieve a checkmate in exactly 3 moves, we need a different approach.

Let's consider:
1... Qd5-e4 (threatening Qe4-e1# or other checks)
   - 2. d5 (trying to block or counter) Qe1+ 
   - 3. Rxe1 Rf1#

However, let's directly analyze a potential 3-move checkmate:
1... Qd5-f3
   - Threatening Qf3-g2# or Rf3-f1# is not immediately possible due to the White rook on c2.
   - 2. Qc2 (or other moves) could be met with a checkmate or a strong threat.

Let's directly check a potential 3-move sequence:
1... Qd5-a5 (or other moves that set up for a potential checkmate)
   - Doesn't directly lead to an obvious checkmate in 3.

Let's directly examine a potential checkmate:
1... Qd5-f3
   - 2. Qc2 Qg2+ 
   - 3. Rxg2 Rf1#

Let's verify this line:
1... Qd5-f3
   - 2. Qc2 (or other moves like Qd1, but Qc2 is more reasonable to block the check) Qg2+ 
   - 3. Rxg2 Rf1#

This line seems to work.

Let's verify the legality and checkmate:
1. 1... Qf3 is legal.
2. 2. Qc2 is a reasonable response.
3. 2... Qg2+ is legal and a check.
4. 3. Rxg2 is forced.
5. 3... Rf1# is checkmate.
