1. The side to move is White, and the objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The current position is given in FEN: 6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1. 
   - White's king is on b4, and the rook is on e5.
   - Black's king is on g8.

3. To identify promising candidate moves, we need to look at the pieces White has and their potential to attack Black's king. 
   - White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5. 
   - The rook on e5 can potentially move to deliver a check or checkmate.

4. Let's analyze potential moves:
   - The White king can move, but it's far from Black's king, and its movement won't directly lead to checkmate.
   - The White rook on e5 is a good candidate to deliver checkmate. We should check if it can directly checkmate or put Black's king in a position to be checkmated.

5. Checking the position:
   - Black's king is on g8, and there are pawns on f7, g7, and h7. 
   - The White rook can potentially checkmate if it can reach the 8th rank or put the king in a position to be checkmated.

6. Let's examine potential checkmate patterns:
   - Re8# is a potential checkmate if the Black king can't escape or interpose a piece.

7. Checking the move Re8+:
   - 1. Re8+ Kh7 (or any other move, but Kh7 is most relevant as it tries to escape)
   - However, we need to directly checkmate in 1 move.

8. Direct checkmate:
   - The move Re8 is checkmate because the king can't escape the check (it's on g8 and can't go to f8 or h8 due to the rook, and other moves put it in check or it's already in check), but we need to verify if it's checkmate without relying on the king being on g8 if it moves.

9. Verifying the checkmate:
   - If 1. Re8+, then Kh7 doesn't work because it's not a checkmate; the king escapes to h7. So, Re8 is not necessarily checkmate unless the king can't move.
   - However, upon closer inspection, 1. Rd5 or other rook moves don't directly checkmate. 
   - The correct checkmate is actually achieved by 1. Rd5, no, this is not correct as it doesn't checkmate.

10. Upon reevaluation:
    - The correct move is actually 1. Re8#, as it directly checkmates the Black king on g8.

Let's verify:
- The White rook can move to e8, putting the Black king in checkmate.
- 1. Re8# is a valid move and checkmates Black.

[FINAL PGN]
