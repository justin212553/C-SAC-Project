1. The given FEN is 4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black because the FEN ends with "b".
   - The White King is on a3, and it is the king that needs to be checkmated.

2. To start, we need to identify the pieces available to Black and their potential moves.
   - Black has a king on c2, a pawn on c3, and two rooks on e8 and f7.
   - The most promising candidate moves involve using the rooks to potentially checkmate the White King.

3. Let's analyze potential checkmates:
   - The White King is on a3, so we need to get a rook to either a1, b2, or b3 to potentially checkmate it, considering the King's limited mobility.
   - One potential checkmate could involve Rea8 (or Rfa8) followed by another rook move to checkmate.

4. Let's examine a potential line:
   - 1... Rea8+ (This move puts the White King in check and limits its response.)
     - The White King can only move to b4 because other moves are not legal (a4 is not possible due to Rb8+ being a potential follow-up, and moving to a2 or a1 would be checkmate or illegal).
   - 1... Rea8+ 2. Kb4 Rb8# (This delivers checkmate as the White King cannot escape the check on b8.)

Let's verify:
- 1... Rea8+ is legal.
- 2. Kb4 is a legal response by White.
- 2... Rb8# is checkmate.

Now, let's check if there's an alternative:
- Another potential first move is Rfa8, but it doesn't lead to a quicker checkmate than Rea8+.

Let's verify the line:
1. The move 1... Rea8+ is legal and puts White in check.
2. The response Kb4 is forced because other moves like Ka4 or Ka2 are either illegal or lead to immediate checkmate.
3. The final move Rb8# is checkmate.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rea8+ 2. Kb4 Rb8#
