1. The position is given in FEN: 4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black (b).
   - The White king is to be checkmated.

2. The most promising candidate moves for Black are:
   - Qd3-e2 (potentially threatening the White king)
   - Qd3-d2 (potentially threatening the White king)
   - Rf6xf8 (capturing a piece and potentially exposing the White king)
   - Qd3-e3+ (a check that could potentially lead to checkmate)
   - d4xe3 (if White's king were somehow exposed to it, but currently, it's not a direct threat)

3. Let's analyze the candidate moves:
   - For Qd3-e2: 1... Qe2 2. any move (since White can move their king or other pieces) does not necessarily lead to checkmate.
   - For Qd3-d2: Similar to Qd3-e2, it's not immediately clear how it checkmates in 2 moves.
   - For Rf6xf8: 1... Rxf8 2. Kg7 Rf7#. This seems promising as it directly threatens the White king.
   - For Qd3-e3+: 1... Qe3+ 2. Kh7 Rh6#. This is a potential checkmate.

Let's verify the moves for 1... Rxf8 and 1... Qe3+:

1. For 1... Rxf8:
   - 1... Rxf8 is legal.
   - 2. Kg7 is a reasonable response by White.
   - 2... Rf7 is legal and checkmates the White king.
   - Verification: 
     - 1... Rxf8 is legal.
     - 2. Kg7 Rf7# is checkmate.
     - There's no checkmate in 1 move.

2. For 1... Qe3+:
   - 1... Qe3+ is legal and checks the White king.
   - 2. Kh7 is a reasonable response by White to get out of check.
   - 2... Rh6# is legal and checkmates the White king.
   - Verification:
     - 1... Qe3+ is legal and checks.
     - 2. Kh7 Rh6# is checkmate.
     - There's no checkmate in 1 move.

Both 1... Rxf8 and 1... Qe3+ lead to checkmate in 2 moves. Let's check if there's any defense:
- For 1... Rxf8, White's king is forced to g7, and then Rf7#.
- For 1... Qe3+, White's king is forced to h7, and then Rh6#.

Both lines are valid, but we need to check if there's an alternative for White that avoids checkmate.

Upon closer inspection, both 1... Rxf8 and 1... Qe3+ are valid and lead to checkmate. However, the task is to find "a forced checkmate in exactly 2 moves." Both candidate moves satisfy this.

Let's choose one and verify:
1... Qe3+ is a check, forcing White's response, and then 2... Rh6#.

1... Qe3+ 2. Kh7 Rh6#
