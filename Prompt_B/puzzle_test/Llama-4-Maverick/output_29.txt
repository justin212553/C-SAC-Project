1. The given FEN is: r1b1Rbk1/1p3p1p/p2q2pQ/3P4/3Nn3/1P1n1PP1/PB4BP/R5K1 w - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is White.
   - The Black king is on g8, and it is the king that White must checkmate.

2. The most promising candidate moves for White are:
   - Qg7# (immediate checkmate, but let's verify if it's possible after analyzing the position)
   - Moves involving the White pieces that can potentially attack the Black king.

First, let's analyze the position:
- White has a Queen on h6, which is already putting pressure on the Black position.
- The Black king is on g8, somewhat exposed but currently safe due to the presence of other Black pieces.
- White has a Rook on e8, which is somewhat awkwardly placed but can potentially be used.
- The White Knight on d4 is well-placed to potentially jump to f5 or other strategic squares.

Let's directly examine potential checkmating sequences:
1. The immediate threat is Qg7#, but it's not directly possible because the Queen is on h6. So, Qg7 is a potential first move if it weren't for the fact that it's not a check and Black can respond in multiple ways.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:
1. Qg7+ is a check and forces a response. If 1... Kg7:, then 2. Nf5+ Kg8 (or other moves, but let's check for a quick mate).

Let's start with 1. Qg7+:
1. Qg7+ Kg7: 
2. Nf5+ Kg8 (forced to avoid the check)
3. Re8# (since the Rook can move to e8, putting the Black king in checkmate)

Let's verify:
- 1. Qg7+ is legal.
- 1... Kg7: is forced because it's a check.
- 2. Nf5+ is legal and puts Black in check.
- 2... Kg8 is a reasonable response to avoid checkmate.
- 3. Re8# is legal and checkmates the Black king.

Now, let's check if there's an earlier checkmate or if this line is the most forced:
- There's no immediate checkmate on the first move.
- The line 1. Qg7+ Kg7: 2. Nf5+ Kg8 3. Re8# is a forced checkmate in 3.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qg7+ Kg7: 2. Nf5+ Kg8 3. Re8#
