1. The side to move is Black, as indicated by the FEN string "3k4/7p/pp1P1rp1/4K3/7r/1P1N1b2/P7/R3R3 b - - 0 1". The objective is to checkmate White's king in exactly 2 moves. White's king is on e5.

2. The most promising candidate moves for Black are those that potentially put White's king in check or prepare to do so on the next move. The pieces available for Black to potentially deliver checkmate or put White in a difficult position are the king (d8), pawns (a6, b6, g6, h7), rook (g6), rook (h4), and bishop (f3). 

   Candidate moves include:
   - Moving the rook on g6 to potentially attack White's king or other White pieces.
   - Moving the rook on h4 to potentially check White's king or prepare a check.
   - Checking with the bishop or pawns if possible.

3. Let's analyze the candidate moves:
   - The rook on g6 can potentially move to e6 or g5 to check White's king. 
   - The rook on h4 can potentially move to e4 or h5 to check White's king.
   - The bishop on f3 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move to g2 or h1 if not blocked or captured.

Let's start with 1...Rg5+:
- 1...Rg5+ 2.Kd4 (forced to move the king) Rg4+ (checkmate is not delivered here, but it's a potential line).
- Upon 2.Kd4, Black can play 2...Rd8#, checkmating White.

Let's verify:
- 1...Rg5+ is legal.
- 2.Kd4 is a reasonable defensive move, and 2...Rd8# is checkmate.
- There's no checkmate in 1 move.

Now, let's check if there's an alternative:
- Another potential check on the first move is 1...Re4+, but White can respond with 2.Kxe4, and it's not checkmate.

Let's directly analyze the best candidate:
1...Rg5+ is a strong move as it puts White's king in check. White's king can only move to d4. So, the sequence is:
1...Rg5+
2.Kd4 Rd8#

This sequence meets the criteria: it's checkmate in exactly 2 moves.
