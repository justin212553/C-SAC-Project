1. The side to move is Black, as indicated by the FEN string ending in "b - - 0 1". The objective is to checkmate White's king.
2. The current position is: 4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R. Black's pieces are: king on g8, rook on e8, bishop on c5, knight on e4, knight on g4, pawn on a7, pawn on b7, pawn on f7, pawn on g7, pawn on p7. White's pieces are: king on c1, queen on d2, rook on h1, knight on f3, pawn on b2, pawn on c2, pawn on d5, pawn on p2.
3. The most promising candidate moves for Black involve using the pieces to attack White's king. The king is on c1, so we need to get a piece to it or to a square it might move to. Black's knights are well-placed to potentially attack the king or supporting squares.

Let's analyze potential moves:
- The Black knights on e4 and g4 are active and could potentially jump into c3 or other threatening positions.
- The Black bishop on c5 is somewhat limited by the White pawn on d5 but could potentially move to other squares.
- The Black rook on e8 could potentially move to e1 or other squares to put pressure on White.

Let's consider a potential checkmate:
1. ... Nge3+ (threatening the king and potentially forcing a response)
2. If White responds with something like Kb1 (since the king needs to move), we can continue with other moves.

Let's start with 1... Nge3+:
1... Nge3+ 
   - If 2. Kb1, then we can consider other moves like Nc3+ or other developing moves.
   - 2... Nc3+ is a potential follow-up, attacking the king again.

Let's explore this line:
1... Nge3+ 
2. Kb1 Nc3+ 
   - Now, 3. Qxc3 is likely met with 3... Nd3+ or other strong moves, but we need to check the exact sequence.

Let's continue:
1... Nge3+ 
2. Kb1 Nc3+ 
3. Qxc3 Nd3+ 
   - This looks promising as it puts the knight in a strong position.

Let's verify the final move:
1... Nge3+ 
2. Kb1 Nc3+ 
3. Qxc3 Nd3+ 
4. Kc1 (or other moves, but this is likely) Re1#

Let's check the legality and the checkmate:
- 1... Nge3+ is legal and checks the king.
- 2. Kb1 is a reasonable response.
- 2... Nc3+ is legal and checks again.
- 3. Qxc3 is forced due to the check.
- 3... Nd3+ is legal and checks again.
- 4. Kc1 Re1# is checkmate.

So, the sequence is:
1... Nge3+ 
2. Kb1 Nc3+ 
3. Qxc3 Nd3+ 
4. Kc1 Re1#

[FINAL PGN]
1... Nge3+ 2. Kb1 Nc3+ 3. Qxc3 Nd3+ 4. Kc1 Re1#
