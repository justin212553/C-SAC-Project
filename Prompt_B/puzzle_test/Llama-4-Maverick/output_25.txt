1. The given FEN is: 2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is White.
   - The king to checkmate is Black's king.

2. The current position is analyzed to identify promising candidate moves for White:
   - White's pieces: King on a4, Queen on f6, Bishop on b5, Rook on c8.
   - Black's pieces: King on a8, Queen on h7, Rook on f7, Bishop on b2, Pawns on b7, a6.
   - The most promising candidate moves involve checking the Black king or threatening it directly.

3. Candidate moves for White:
   - Qxa6+ (checking the king and potentially weakening the Black position)
   - Rc7 (potentially threatening the king and other pieces)
   - Other moves like moving the King or Bishop are less direct.

Let's analyze Qxa6+:
1. Qxa6+ bxa6
   - This move is forced as it's a check.
2. Rc7+ Kb8 (or Ka7, but it leads to a similar outcome)
   - White can play 3. Rb7#, checkmating Black.

Let's verify:
- 1. Qxa6+ is legal.
- 1... bxa6 is forced.
- 2. Rc7+ is legal and checks the king.
- 2... Kb8 is a reasonable defense.
- 3. Rb7# is legal and checkmates.

Now, let's check if there's an earlier checkmate or if the moves are legal:
- There's no checkmate on the first move.
- The sequence does not have an earlier checkmate.

Let's directly examine the move sequence:
1. Qxa6+ bxa6
2. Rc7+ Kb8
3. Rb7#

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qxa6+ bxa6 2. Rc7+ Kb8 3. Rb7#
