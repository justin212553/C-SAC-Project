1. The side to move is White, as indicated by the 'w' in the FEN string. The objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The FEN string is: 5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8. Let's decode it:
   - The Black king is on g8 (since the position is "5rkr", it means there's a 'k' on g8).
   - White pieces: a Knight on e4 and a Rook on g4, and the King on g2.
   - Black pieces: a King on g8, Rooks on f8 and h8, and pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
3. The task is to find a checkmate in exactly 1 move. Let's analyze potential moves:
   - The White Rook on g4 can potentially give check or checkmate on the g-file.
   - The White Knight on e4 can potentially give check or support other pieces.
4. Let's examine potential checkmate patterns:
   - The Black King is on g8. For checkmate, we need to attack it with no legal moves available for it to escape.
   - The White Rook on g4 is already on the same file as the Black King. If it moves to g7 or g8, it could potentially check or checkmate.
   - Moving the Rook to g7 (Rg7) would put it on the same rank as the Black pawns and could be a strong move, but we need to check if it's checkmate.
   - Moving the Rook to g8 (Rg8) would capture the Black Rook on h8 (if it were on h8, but it's actually on f8 and h8, so this is not a check) and not directly check the King because of the interposing Rook on f8.
5. Let's directly analyze the most promising candidate move:
   - Rg7 is not checkmate because the Black King can move to f8 or h8.
   - However, if we consider Rg8+, it is check. The Black King can respond with ...Kf8 or ...Kh8, but then we can analyze further.
   - Upon closer inspection, Rxh8# (Rg8# is not possible due to the presence of the Black Rook on f8) is not directly available, but Rg8+ is a check. If Black responds with K/Rxg8, we should look for a checkmate.
   - Actually, the move "Nf6#" is checkmate because the Knight can jump to f6, putting the Black King in checkmate. The Black King cannot capture the Knight due to it being supported by the Rook on g4 indirectly controlling g7 and h7, and directly there's no piece attacking the Knight. Let's verify:
     - The Knight on e4 moves to f6: Nf6+.
     - The Black King on g8 is in check.
     - The King cannot capture the Knight because it's not adjacent.
     - The check is on f6, and there's no interposing piece.
     - The King cannot escape to a safe square (f8, h8) because Nf6# is checkmate due to the Rook on g4 controlling the g-file and indirectly supporting the Knight.
6. Let's verify the legality and checkmate condition for Nf6#:
   - The move Nf6 is legal.
   - It puts the Black King in checkmate.
