1. The side to move is Black, as indicated by the FEN string "8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1". The objective is to checkmate White in exactly 1 move.
2. The White king is on g1, and it is the target for checkmate. The Black pieces are a king on b5 and a rook on e4. 
3. To checkmate the White king, we need to consider the possible moves of the Black pieces and their potential to attack g1 or any other square that could lead to checkmate.
4. The Black rook on e4 can potentially move to g4 or e1 to put the White king in checkmate, as g1 is a potential checkmate square if the rook can reach e1.
5. Let's examine the candidate move 1...Re1#. This move is legal as it follows the rules of chess for the rook's movement. It puts the White king on g1 in checkmate because the king is on the same rank and there are no intervening pieces, and the king cannot capture the rook.
6. Checking for other potential checkmates, we see that 1...Rg4+ is check but not checkmate because White can block with a pawn (2.g3 or 2.f3) or potentially move the king away if it were possible, but here it's not a checkmate.
7. Verifying that 1...Re1# is indeed checkmate: The White king on g1 is in check from the Black rook on e1, and there's no legal move for White to capture the rook, block the check, or move the king to safety.
8. Since 1...Re1# is a legal move that results in checkmate in exactly 1 move, it is the solution.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Re1#
