1. The given FEN is 3r1r1k/pp3b1p/2qpQp2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is White.
   - The Black king is the one to be checkmated, currently on h8.

2. The most promising candidate moves for White involve the Queen and potentially other pieces that can attack the Black king or support the Queen. 
   - The White Queen is already on e6, putting pressure on f7 and potentially supporting a checkmate.
   - Other pieces like the Knight on d5 and the Rook on d1 can potentially be involved.

3. Let's analyze potential moves:
   - The White Queen on e6 is already putting pressure on the position. A check with Qg8 or Qxf7 is not immediately possible, but Qh3 or Qg4 could be considered if followed by other pieces. However, the most direct approach seems to be using the Queen to force a checkmate or create a threat that Black cannot defend.
   - One potential checkmate pattern involves Qg8+ followed by a Rook or other piece delivering checkmate. However, Qg8 is not directly available.
   - Another potential checkmate pattern is using the Queen and other pieces to create an unstoppable threat.

4. Let's directly examine some promising moves:
   - Qg8+ is not available, but if we consider Rxg8 or a similar motif, we need to prepare it.
   - One potential move is Qf7, putting pressure on g8 and potentially setting up a checkmate.
   - Upon closer inspection, 1. Qg8+ Rxg8 2. Nf7# is a potential checkmate pattern if the Queen could get to g8.

Let's directly check the move 1. Qh5, aiming to force a checkmate:
- 1. Qh5+ Kg8 (forced to get out of check)
- 2. Qf7# (checkmate)

Let's verify:
- 1. Qh5 is legal.
- 1... Kg8 is a reasonable response.
- 2. Qf7# is checkmate.

Now, let's check if there's an earlier checkmate or if this line works:
- There's no checkmate in 1 move.
- The line 1. Qh5+ Kg8 2. Qf7# is valid and checkmates in 2 moves.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qh5+ Kg8 2. Qf7#
