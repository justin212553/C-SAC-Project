1. The given FEN is: r3r3/p7/1p1n1B2/7R/4k3/PP1p1RP1/7P/3K4 w - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is White.
   - The Black king is on e4, which is the king we need to checkmate.

2. The most promising candidate moves for White are:
   - Rxg4+ (since it puts the rook in a potentially strong position and checks the king)
   - Other moves like moving the King or other pieces, but Rxg4+ seems particularly strong because it puts the rook on the same file as the Black king and potentially exposes the king to further attack.

3. Let's analyze Rxg4+:
   - 1. Rxg4+ Kf5 (Forced, as the king must move out of check)
   - Now, we need to find a checkmate on the second move. 
   - A potential checkmate could be achieved by Rh5# because it would put the White rook on h5, attacking the Black king on f5, with no escape.

4. Checking the line:
   - 1. Rxg4+ Kf5
   - 2. Rh5#
   - Verifying legality and checkmate:
     - Rxg4+ is legal.
     - Kf5 is a legal response by Black.
     - Rh5# is legal and checkmates the Black king.

5. Let's verify if there's an earlier checkmate or if this is the only solution:
   - Other moves like 1. Kd2 or 1. Ke1 do not checkmate immediately and do not seem to force a checkmate in 2.
   - 1. Rxg4+ is the most promising first move as it checks the king.

6. Concluding the best line:
   - The best forced line is 1. Rxg4+ Kf5 2. Rh5#.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Rxg4+ Kf5 2. Rh5#
