1. The given FEN is 8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P3q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black because it's indicated by 'b' in the FEN string.
   - The objective is to checkmate White, whose king is on a2.

2. List the most promising candidate moves for Black:
   - The Black pieces are: Ka5, Qf3, Rc1, Pa4, and Be4.
   - Potential moves involve checking the White king or setting up a checkmate. 
   - Candidate moves could be Qf3 checking moves, or moving the Rc1 to potentially expose or check the White king.

3. Analyze the position:
   - White's king is on a2, and it's somewhat exposed but defended by the White queen on h2 and the rook on f3 is not defended but not immediately threatening.
   - Black's queen on f3 is well-placed to potentially check the White king.
   - The Black rook on c1 is in a relatively safe position but could potentially move to c2 to check.

Let's examine potential checkmates:
1. ...Qf3 checking moves: The most direct check would involve the queen moving to a square that checks the king on a2. 
   - One potential check is Qxa3+ (1...Qxa3+), as it directly attacks the king.

Let's analyze 1...Qxa3+:
- 1...Qxa3+ 2.Kxa3 Rc3+ 
  - If 2.Kxa3, then Rc3+ is a check.
  - 2...Rc3+ 3.Kb2 (or any other move) is followed by a potential checkmate or further checks.
  - A possible continuation is 3.Kb2 Rb3+ (if Kb2) or other moves if different.

Let's verify a potential checkmate:
- 1...Qxa3+ 2.Kxa3 Rc3+ 3.Kb2 Rb3#
   - Checking legality and checkmate:
     - 1...Qxa3+ is legal.
     - 2.Kxa3 is forced as it's a king in check.
     - 2...Rc3+ is legal and checks the king again.
     - 3.Kb2 is a reasonable response, and then 3...Rb3# is checkmate.

4. Verifying the checkmate:
   - Every move is legal.
   - Checkmate is delivered on the final move (3...Rb3#).
   - There's no earlier checkmate before move 3.
