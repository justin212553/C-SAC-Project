1. The side to move is Black, as indicated by the FEN string "5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1" where 'b' denotes it's Black's turn. The White king is on h8, and this is the king that Black must checkmate.
2. The Black pieces are a king on f8, a queen on g7, and a bishop on g6. The most promising candidate moves for Black involve using the queen and bishop to checkmate the White king on h8. The White king is somewhat exposed, and the Black queen is already in an attacking position. Potential checkmate patterns could involve the queen moving to h7 or h6 with checkmate, potentially supported by the bishop.
3. Let's examine potential checkmate moves:
   - The Black queen can potentially move to h7 or h6 to checkmate White's king on h8. 
   - Qh7# or Qh6# would be checkmate if the White king had no escape and wasn't already in a checkmated state without considering other pieces.
   - Checking the position: the White king is on h8, and the Black queen is on g7. The move Qh7# is not possible because h7 is not a valid move for the queen (it's occupied by an invisible piece, but more accurately, it's not a valid checkmate because the square is not under attack directly by the queen from g7 without considering other factors like the king's position and potential interpositions).
   - However, Qh6+ is a potential check, but it is not checkmate because the White king can escape to g8 or h7 is not available due to being potentially under attack or not being a valid square to move to due to being out of the board or occupied. Yet, upon closer inspection, Qh6 is not a valid check as the king can move to g8 or h7 if it were empty. The correct checkmate pattern involves directly attacking h8 or forcing the king into a position where it cannot escape check.
   - Upon closer inspection, the Black queen can directly checkmate the White king with Qg8# or potentially other moves if they were available and legal.
4. Let's directly analyze the most plausible checkmate:
   - The move Qg8# is a checkmate. It's a legal move for the Black queen, and it directly checkmates the White king on h8.

Let's verify:
- The move Qg8# is legal.
- It is checkmate because the White king on h8 is in check and cannot escape the check (no valid moves to make to get out of check).
- There is no checkmate before move 1, as we've identified a checkmate on the first move.

The best forced line is: 1... Qg8#

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qg8#
