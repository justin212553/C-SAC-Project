1. The side to move is White, as indicated by "w" in the FEN notation. The objective is to checkmate Black's king.
2. The current position is given in FEN: 8/p1K5/k1P5/8/1p6/3P1P2/5R2/4R3 w - - 0 1. Let's decode this:
   - The White king is on c7, and Black's king is on a6.
   - White has pawns on c6 and d3 and f3, and rooks on f2 and e1.
   - Black has pawns on a7 and b4.

3. To start, we need to identify potential checks or threats that could lead to checkmate. The Black king is on a6, so we should look for ways to attack it or restrict its movement.

4. The most promising candidate moves involve using the White rooks to potentially check or checkmate the Black king, or using the pawns to restrict the king's movement or support a check/checkmate.

5. Let's examine potential first moves:
   - The White king is somewhat exposed on c7 but is somewhat safe due to the presence of the c6 pawn and the fact that Black's king is somewhat restricted.
   - Moving the White king is not immediately promising due to the potential for it to be exposed further.
   - The rooks can potentially be used to check or checkmate.

6. Let's consider the rooks:
   - The rook on f2 can potentially move to a2 or f1 to put pressure on the Black king or its pawns.
   - The rook on e1 can potentially move to e6 or other squares to put pressure on the Black position.

7. Let's analyze a potential checkmate:
   - If White plays 1.Ra2+ (Rook on f2 to a2), Black's king is checked and must move to b6 or b5. 
   - If 1... Kb6, then 2. Rb1# is checkmate because the Black king is on b6, and the White rook on b1 covers the king, with the c6 pawn supporting by controlling d7 and potentially other squares.

8. Let's verify the line:
   - 1. Ra2+ is legal.
   - 1... Kb6 is a reasonable response by Black to get out of check.
   - 2. Rb1# is legal and checkmates Black's king.

9. Checking for alternative responses by Black:
   - If 1. Ra2+ Kb5, White still needs to find a checkmate. However, 2. Rd1 (or other moves) doesn't immediately checkmate. Let's verify if there's a checkmate: 2. Re5+ Ka4 (or other moves) doesn't directly lead to a simple checkmate. So, let's focus on the initial promising line.

10. Verifying there's no earlier checkmate:
    - On the first move, 1. Ra2+ is check, but it's not checkmate. So, there's no checkmate in 1 move.

Given the analysis, the most promising line is:
1. Ra2+ Kb6
2. Rb1#

Let's format this as per PGN notation.

1. Ra2+ Kb6 2. Rb1#
