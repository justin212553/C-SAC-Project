1. The given FEN is r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n4/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1. 
   - The side to move is Black because it's indicated by 'b' in the FEN string.
   - The White king is on e1, and it's the king that needs to be checkmated.

2. The most promising candidate moves for Black are those that could potentially attack the White king or set up a checkmate. 
   - The Black pieces that could potentially attack the White king directly or indirectly are the rook on c2, the knight on d4, and the bishop on g4 (and to some extent, the bishop on h4).
   - Candidate moves include Rc1+ (using the rook to potentially put the White king in a vulnerable position), and moving the knight or bishops to more active squares.

3. Let's analyze the candidate moves:
   - One promising line starts with 1... Rc1+, aiming to disrupt the White king's position.
   - After 1... Rc1+, White's response could be 2.Kd2, moving the king away from the potential pin.
   - Then, we need to find a follow-up for Black that continues the attack.

Let's examine a potential line:
1... Rc1+ 
2. Kd2 Nf3+ (using the knight to attack the White king and prepare for further checks or checkmate)
3. Ke2 (or other possible moves, but this seems a likely response to avoid the knight fork)
3... Rxf2+ (capturing the rook and putting it on the f-file, potentially setting up for checkmate or gaining a significant advantage)
4. Kxf2 (forced to recapture)
4... Nd4+ or other moves don't directly lead to checkmate, so let's directly analyze a more promising sequence.

Let's directly analyze a potential checkmate sequence:
1. The Black rook on c2 can potentially be used to check or checkmate.
2. The presence of the White king on e1 and the potential for discovery with the knight on e8 is intriguing.

Let's directly check a promising line:
1... Rxf2 
This move is a good starting point because it directly attacks the White rook and opens up potential lines.
2. Rxf2 (forced to recapture)
2... Rc1+ 
3. Kd2 (or other king moves, but let's see)
3... Nf3+ 
4. Ke2 Rxe1#

Let's verify the line:
1... Rxf2 
2. Rxf2 Rc1+ 
3. Kd2 Nf3+ 
4. Ke2 Rxe1#

This line seems to checkmate in 4 moves.
