1. The side to move is White, as indicated by 'w' in the FEN notation. The task is to checkmate the Black king.
2. The Black king is on c2. We need to analyze the position to find a checkmate in exactly 2 moves.

First, let's analyze the given position: 
1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1

The White king is on b8, and the Black king is on c2. The material is significantly imbalanced in favor of Black, but White has a mating opportunity.

The most promising candidate moves involve the White queen, as it is the most mobile and powerful piece. The White queen is on d4.

Let's examine potential moves:
1. Qe3: This move puts the queen on a potentially strong square, eyeing the Black king and preparing for a potential checkmate.

Let's analyze the candidate move Qe3:
1. Qe3 Kb1 (forced to move the king, as it's currently in check or potentially in check)
   - If 1... Kb1, then 2. Qb3# or other checkmates could be explored.

However, let's directly examine the most promising lines:
1. Qxa4+ Kb1 2. Qb3# is a potential checkmate.

Let's verify this line:
1. Qxa4+ is a check, as the Black king is on c2.
   - 1... Kb1 is a reasonable response, moving the king to a relatively safer square.
   - 2. Qb3# is checkmate, as the queen covers all potential escape squares.

Let's check for legality and checkmate conditions:
- 1. Qxa4+ is legal.
- 1... Kb1 is a valid response.
- 2. Qb3# is legal and checkmates the Black king.

Now, let's verify if there's an earlier checkmate:
- On the first move, White doesn't have a checkmate. Qxa4+ is a check, and it leads to a checkmate on the next move.

Therefore, the line 1. Qxa4+ Kb1 2. Qb3# is a valid checkmate in 2 moves.
