1. The side to move is Black, as indicated by the FEN string "8/6q1/8/7k/4Q3/7P/2r2p1K/5R2 b - - 0 1". The objective is to checkmate White's king.
2. The Black pieces are a queen on g7, a rook on c2, a pawn on f2, and a king on h5. The White pieces are a queen on e4, a rook on f1, a pawn on h3, and a king on h2. 
3. The most promising candidate moves for Black are:
   - Qg7-h6 (potentially putting the White king in a vulnerable position)
   - Qg7-g2+ (forcing the White king to move and potentially weakening its position)
   - Rc2xf2 (potentially removing a White piece and exposing the White king)
4. Let's analyze the candidate moves:
   - For 1...Qh6, there's no immediate checkmate: White can play 2.Qe4-e5+ and then various moves, but it doesn't seem to lead to a forced checkmate in 3.
   - For 1...Qg2+, it forces 2.Kh1 (since 2.Kg3?? f1Q+ wins immediately), and then we can continue with a move like 2...Rf2, but we need to verify if it leads to checkmate in 3.
   - For 1...Rxf2, it directly attacks the White king's position and could potentially lead to a quick checkmate.

Let's examine 1...Qg2+:
1. 1...Qg7-g2+ is legal and forces 2.Kh2-h1 (2.Kg3? f1Q+ 3.Rxf1 Qxf1 is a quick win but let's focus on the main line).
2. Then, 2...Rc2xf2 is a strong move, attacking the White rook and putting pressure on the f-file.
3. White's best response is likely 3.Qe4-e5+, but we need to verify if it delays checkmate.

Let's analyze the line:
1...Qg2+ 2.Kh1 Rxf2 3.Qe5+ (or any other move) should be checkmate or lead to it.

Calculating the line:
1. 1...Qg7-g2+ (check)
2. 2.Kh2-h1 Rc2xf2
3. If White plays 3.Qe4-e5+, Black can respond with 3...Rf2-g2# (checkmate).

Verifying:
- 1...Qg2+ is legal.
- 2...Rxf2 is legal.
- 3...Rg2# is checkmate.
- There's no checkmate before move 3.

Let's directly check if there's a faster or alternative mate:
- 1...Rxf2+ is another promising line: 2.Rxf2 (forced) Qg2#.

So, a faster checkmate is found:
1. 1...Rc2xf2+ is a check.
2. 2.Rf1xf2 is forced.
3. 2...Qg7-g2# is checkmate.

Thus, the correct line is:
1...Rxf2+ 2.Rxf2 Qg2#

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rxf2+ 2. Rxf2 Qg2#
