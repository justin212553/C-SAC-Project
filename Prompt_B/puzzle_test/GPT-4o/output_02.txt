--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is Black's turn to move ("b" in the FEN).
   - Black must deliver checkmate to the White king on h7.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has a queen on g7, a bishop on g6, and a king on f8. The White king is on h7.
   - The most promising moves involve using the queen or bishop to deliver checkmate, as the Black king cannot contribute to the attack.

3. **Evaluate candidate moves:**
   - **Move 1: Qh6#**
     - The Black queen moves to h6, delivering check to the White king on h7.
     - The White king has no legal moves (it is surrounded by its own pieces and the Black queen controls all escape squares).
     - This is checkmate.
   - **Move 2: Bg6 (or any other bishop move):**
     - Moving the bishop does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.
   - **Move 3: Any king move (e.g., Kf7):**
     - Moving the Black king does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.

4. **Verify that Qh6# is the only move that delivers checkmate in 1:**
   - Qh6 is legal and delivers checkmate immediately.
   - No other move delivers checkmate in 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only move that forces checkmate in 1 is Qh6#.
