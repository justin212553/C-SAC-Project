--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is White's turn to move ("w").
   - White must deliver checkmate to the Black king on a6 in exactly 2 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several attacking pieces: the rook on f2, the rook on e1, and the pawn on c6.
   - Candidate moves include checks such as 1. Ra1+, 1. Re4+, and 1. c7.

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **1. Ra1+:**
     - Black's only legal move is 1... Kb5.
     - White can then play 2. Ra5#, delivering checkmate. The Black king is trapped by its own pawns and the White rook on f2.
     - This line satisfies the condition of a forced mate in 2 moves.

   - **1. Re4+:**
     - Black's only legal move is 1... Kb5.
     - White cannot deliver checkmate on the second move. For example, 2. Rb2+ is a check, but not mate.
     - This line fails to meet the objective.

   - **1. c7:**
     - This move is not a check, so Black can respond with 1... b3 or 1... Kb5.
     - White cannot deliver checkmate on the second move in either case.
     - This line fails to meet the objective.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The move 1. Ra1+ forces the Black king to move to b5, and 2. Ra5# is a checkmate.
   - There is no earlier checkmate before move 2, and all moves are legal.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The forced mate in 2 moves is 1. Ra1+ Kb5 2. Ra5#.
