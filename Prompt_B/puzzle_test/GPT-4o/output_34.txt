1. **Side to move and objective**:  
   Black is to move, and the task is to deliver a forced checkmate in exactly 4 moves. The White king is on e1, and Black must coordinate its pieces to deliver checkmate on the fourth move.

2. **Candidate moves**:  
   Black has several active pieces (queen, rooks, and knights) and must use them to create a forced sequence. The White king is somewhat restricted, and Black can exploit this by delivering checks and forcing the king into a vulnerable position.  
   Promising candidate moves include checks with the rooks or queen, as well as moves that restrict the White king's mobility.

3. **Concrete calculation of lines**:  
   Let's analyze the most forcing moves step by step:  

   - **1... Rc1+**: This forces the White king to move to d2, as the rook on f2 covers e2.  
   - **2. Kd2 Rd1+**: Another check, forcing the king to move to c3.  
   - **3. Kc3 Nb5+**: A knight check that forces the king to move to b4.  
   - **4. Kb4 a5#**: The pawn delivers checkmate, with the White king trapped by its own pieces and Black's pawns and knight.

4. **Verification**:  
   - Each move is legal and forces the White king to move as described.  
   - Checkmate is delivered on the fourth move with no earlier mate possible.  
   - The sequence is forced, as White has no alternative defensive moves to avoid the mate.
