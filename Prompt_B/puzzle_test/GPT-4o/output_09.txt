1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   - White is to move, as indicated by "w" in the FEN string.  
   - The Black king is on f8, and White must deliver checkmate in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White**:  
   - White has three pieces: the king on e6, the pawn on f6, and the pawn on f7.  
   - The pawn on f7 is one square away from promotion, which could lead to a decisive move.  
   - Promoting the pawn to a queen or rook could deliver checkmate immediately.  

3. **Analyze each candidate move**:  
   - **Move 1: f7-f8=Q**  
     - Promoting the pawn to a queen places the Black king in check.  
     - The Black king has no legal moves because all escape squares (e8, g8, e7, g7) are controlled by White's pieces.  
     - This is checkmate.  

   - **Move 2: f7-f8=R**  
     - Promoting the pawn to a rook also places the Black king in check.  
     - Similar to the queen promotion, the Black king has no legal moves, and this is checkmate.  

   - **Move 3: King moves (e.g., Ke5, Ke7, etc.)**  
     - Any king move fails to deliver checkmate in 1 move.  

   - **Move 4: Pawn f6-f7**  
     - Advancing the pawn does not deliver checkmate in 1 move.  

4. **Verify the solution**:  
   - Promoting the pawn to either a queen or a rook on f8 delivers checkmate in exactly 1 move.  
   - No other moves achieve checkmate in 1 move.
