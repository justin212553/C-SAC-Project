--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is Black's turn to move ("b" in the FEN string).
   - Black must deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 2 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has two rooks (on e8 and f7) and a pawn (on c3) that can potentially contribute to the attack.
   - The White king is on a3, and it is surrounded by pawns and pieces, limiting its mobility.
   - The rooks are well-positioned to deliver checks and control key squares.

3. **Analyze candidate moves and calculate concrete lines:**
   - **Candidate move 1: 1... Ra8+**
     - This move checks the White king on a3. The king has no escape squares because it is blocked by its own pawns and pieces.
     - White must block the check with 2. b6.
     - Black can then deliver checkmate with 2... axb6# (the pawn captures on b6, delivering mate).
     - This line satisfies the requirement of mate in 2 moves.

   - **Candidate move 2: 1... Re3**
     - This move attacks the White king indirectly, but it does not deliver a check immediately. White can respond with a move like 2. b6, and Black cannot deliver mate in exactly 2 moves. This line fails.

   - **Candidate move 3: 1... Rf8**
     - This move does not deliver a check and does not lead to mate in 2 moves. It fails.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The line starting with 1... Ra8+ is legal and forces mate in exactly 2 moves.
   - The final position after 2... axb6# is checkmate because the White king is completely surrounded and cannot escape.
