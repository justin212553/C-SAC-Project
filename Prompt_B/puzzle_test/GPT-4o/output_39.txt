--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Side to move and target king**:  
   White is to move, and the objective is to checkmate Black's king in exactly 4 moves. Black's king is currently on e8, and White has a strong attacking position with the queen on g3, the bishop on g5, and the knight on b5.

2. **Promising candidate moves**:  
   White has several attacking options, including checks and threats. The most forcing moves are:  
   - Qc7+: A direct check that forces Black's king to move or the queen to block.  
   - Nd6+: A knight check that attacks the king and forces a response.  
   - Nc7+: A knight check that attacks the king and rook.  
   - Other quiet moves like castling or repositioning pieces are less forcing and unlikely to lead to a forced mate in 4.

3. **Concrete calculation of lines**:  
   Let's analyze the most forcing moves to find a mate in exactly 4 moves:  

   **Line 1: 1. Qc7+**  
   - 1... Nc6 (blocking the check)  
   - 2. Nd6# is immediate mate. This is a mate in 2, so it does not satisfy the "mate in 4" condition.  

   **Line 2: 1. Nd6+**  
   - 1... Qxd6 (forced, as the king has no escape squares)  
   - 2. Qxd6 (recapturing the queen and threatening mate)  
   - 2... f6 (trying to create an escape square for the king)  
   - 3. Nc7+ Kf7  
   - 4. Qxe6# delivers mate. This is a valid mate in 4.  

   **Line 3: 1. Nc7+**  
   - 1... Kd8 (forced, as the king has no other moves)  
   - 2. Qd6 (threatening mate on e7 or f8)  
   - 2... Qxc3+ (desperation to delay mate)  
   - 3. bxc3 Rb8  
   - 4. Nde6# delivers mate. This is also a valid mate in 4.  

   Comparing the lines, both Line 2 and Line 3 lead to mate in 4, but Line 2 (starting with 1. Nd6+) is more direct and forcing.

4. **Verification**:  
   - Every move in Line 2 is legal.  
   - Checkmate is delivered on the 4th move.  
   - There is no earlier mate before move 4.
