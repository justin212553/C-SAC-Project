--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on h7 in exactly 3 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several checks available: Qg6+, Qc2+, and Qg8+. Among these, Qg6+ appears most forcing as it directly attacks the Black king and limits its mobility.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 3 moves:**
   - **Line 1: 1. Qg6+ Kh8**
     - Black's king is forced to move to h8 (the only legal square).
     - White can then play 2. Qxh6+ Kg8, forcing the Black king to g8.
     - Finally, 3. Qg7# delivers checkmate. The Black king is trapped, and no earlier mate occurs.

   - **Line 2: 1. Qg6+ Kh8 2. Qxh6+ Qh5**
     - If Black tries to interpose with 2... Qh5 instead of moving the king, White can still play 3. Qxh5#, delivering checkmate on the third move.

4. **Verify that no earlier checkmate occurs:**
   - In all variations, checkmate is delivered on the third move, and there is no faster mate.

5. **Conclude the best forced line:**
   - The sequence 1. Qg6+ Kh8 2. Qxh6+ Kg8 3. Qg7# is the cleanest and most forcing line.

[FINAL PGN]

1. Qg6+ Kh8 2. Qxh6+ Kg8 3. Qg7#
