--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - Black is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the White king on e5 in exactly 2 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has several attacking pieces: the rook on h4, the rook on f6, and the bishop on f3. The White king is exposed on e5, and Black can use checks to force it into a vulnerable position.
   - Candidate moves include: 1... Rh5+, 1... Rf5+, and 1... Bf4+.

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **Line 1: 1... Rh5+**
     - White's king must move to f6 (1. Ke6 is illegal due to the rook on f6).
     - After 2... Bf4#, the White king is checkmated. The bishop on f3 covers e5 and g5, while the rook on h5 covers the entire fifth rank.
     - This line delivers checkmate in exactly 2 moves.

   - **Line 2: 1... Rf5+**
     - White's king must move to e6 (1. Ke5 is illegal due to the rook on f5).
     - After 2... Bf4#, the White king is checkmated. The bishop on f3 covers e5 and g5, while the rook on f5 covers the entire fifth rank.
     - This line also delivers checkmate in exactly 2 moves.

   - **Line 3: 1... Bf4+**
     - White's king must move to f6 (1. Ke6 is illegal due to the rook on f6).
     - After 2... Rh5#, the White king is checkmated. The rook on h5 covers the fifth rank, and the bishop on f4 covers e5 and g5.
     - This line delivers checkmate in exactly 2 moves.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - All three lines deliver checkmate in exactly 2 moves, but 1... Rh5+ is the most direct and intuitive move. It forces the White king into a position where Black can deliver checkmate with 2... Bf4#.
