--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify the side to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - White is to move, as indicated by the FEN string.
   - The objective is to checkmate Black's king on e8 in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several attacking pieces (rooks, bishops, knights) and can deliver checks or set up threats. The most forcing moves involve checks or moves that restrict the Black king's mobility.

3. **Analyze candidate moves and calculate concrete lines:**
   - **Candidate 1: 1. Rc8+**  
     This move forces the Black king to move to d7 (the only legal move). White can then continue with forcing moves to restrict the king and deliver checkmate in exactly 4 moves.
     
     Line:  
     1. Rc8+ Kd7  
     2. Bg4+ Rf5 (forced to block the check)  
     3. Bxf5# (checkmate in 3 moves, not 4).  
     This line fails because it results in mate in 3, not 4.

   - **Candidate 2: 1. Nf6+**  
     This move forces the Black king to move to f8 (the only legal move). White can then continue with forcing moves to deliver checkmate in exactly 4 moves.  
     
     Line:  
     1. Nf6+ Kf8  
     2. Bh6+ Rg7 (forced to block the check)  
     3. Bxg7+ Rxg7  
     4. Rf7# (checkmate in 4 moves).  
     This line works perfectly and satisfies the condition of mate in 4.

   - **Candidate 3: 1. Ra8**  
     This move threatens checkmate on a8, but it is not forcing, as Black can respond with moves like 1... Rxa1 or 1... Rf1, delaying the mate beyond 4 moves.  
     This line fails because it is not forcing.

4. **Verify the chosen line (Candidate 2):**
   - Every move in the line 1. Nf6+ Kf8 2. Bh6+ Rg7 3. Bxg7+ Rxg7 4. Rf7# is legal.
   - Checkmate is delivered on the 4th move, and there is no earlier mate.
   - Black's responses are forced at every step.
