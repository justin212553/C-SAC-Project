--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   - According to the FEN, it is Black's turn to move. Black must checkmate the White king.  
   - The White king is located on a3, and Black has pieces that can potentially deliver checkmate: a bishop on g5 and a rook on h2.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black**:  
   - Black's rook on h2 can move to h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, or h8.  
   - Black's bishop on g5 can move to f4, e3, d2, c1, h4, or h6.  
   - Black can also consider pawn moves, but they are unlikely to deliver checkmate in 1 move.  

3. **Analyze each candidate move for a forced checkmate in 1 move**:  
   - **Rook h3**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Rook h4**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Rook h5**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Rook h6**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Rook h7**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Rook h8**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Bishop f4**: This move does not check the White king. Not a candidate.  
   - **Bishop e3**: This move does not check the White king. Not a candidate.  
   - **Bishop d2**: This move does not check the White king. Not a candidate.  
   - **Bishop c1**: This move does not check the White king. Not a candidate.  
   - **Bishop h4**: This move checks the White king, but the king can escape to b4. Not checkmate.  
   - **Bishop h6**: This move checks the White king, and the king has no escape squares. This is checkmate.  

4. **Verify the final move**:  
   - **Bishop h6** is legal and delivers checkmate.  
   - The White king on a3 is in check from the bishop on h6.  
   - The White king cannot move to b4, b3, or b2 because those squares are controlled by Black's pawns on c5 and c4.  
   - The White king cannot move to a4 because it is controlled by Black's pawn on b5.  
   - The White king cannot move to a2 because it is controlled by Black's rook on h2.  
   - There are no other White pieces that can block the check or capture the bishop.  

Conclusion: **Bishop h6** is the only move that delivers checkmate in 1 move.
