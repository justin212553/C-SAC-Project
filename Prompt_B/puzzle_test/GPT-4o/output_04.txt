1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - According to the FEN, it is Black's turn to move ("b" indicates Black to move).
   - Black must deliver checkmate to the White king on g1 in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has only one piece capable of delivering a check: the rook on e4.
   - The rook can move to squares that attack the White king, such as e1, e2, e3, or e5. However, only e1 appears to be a direct checkmate possibility.

3. **Calculate a concrete line for each candidate move:**
   - **Rook to e1 (Re1):**
     - This move places the White king in check.
     - The White king on g1 has no escape squares because:
       - f1, f2, g2, and h2 are blocked by White's own pawns.
       - h1 is protected by the Black rook on e1.
     - There are no other White pieces that can block the check or capture the rook.
     - Therefore, Re1 is checkmate.

   - **Other moves (e.g., Re2, Re3, Re5):**
     - These moves do not deliver checkmate in 1 move, as they either fail to check the White king or allow the king to escape.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - Re1 is legal and delivers checkmate in exactly 1 move.
   - No faster checkmate exists, as Black cannot checkmate in 0 moves.
   - No slower checkmate is acceptable, as the task requires mate in 1.
