--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   Black is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the White king in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for Black**:  
   Black has several attacking options, including checks and threats. The position is complex, but the most promising moves involve exploiting White's exposed king and weak squares around it.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 4 moves**:  
   Black must deliver checkmate on the fourth move, ensuring no faster mate occurs. The key idea is to use the queen and other pieces to force the White king into a vulnerable position.

   - **Candidate move 1**: 1... Nd3+  
     This move forces White's king to move or the knight to be captured. It opens up attacking possibilities for Black's queen and other pieces.

     Line:  
     1... Nd3+ 2. Kd1 (forced) Qf5 3. e4 Qxe4 4. Qc2#  

     This line delivers checkmate on the fourth move, with no faster mate possible.

   - **Candidate move 2**: 1... Qb1+  
     This move also forces White's king to move or the rook to block. However, it does not lead to a forced mate in 4 moves.

4. **Verify legality and checkmate**:  
   The line 1... Nd3+ 2. Kd1 Qf5 3. e4 Qxe4 4. Qc2# is legal, forces White's moves, and delivers checkmate on the fourth move. No faster mate is possible.
