--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN indicates it is White to move ("w").
   - White must checkmate the Black king on g8.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - White has several pieces that can deliver checks: the knight on e4 and the rook on g4.
   - Candidate moves include:
     - Rg4-g8+
     - Rg4-h4 (not a check, so not relevant)
     - Ne4-g5+ (not a checkmate, as the Black king can escape to h8)
     - Ne4-f6+ (not a checkmate, as the Black king can escape to h8)

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move.**
   - **1. Rg4-g8#**
     - The rook moves to g8, delivering check to the Black king.
     - The Black king on g8 has no legal moves:
       - h7 and f7 are occupied by Black pawns.
       - h8 is protected by the White rook on g8.
     - The Black rook on f8 cannot block the check, nor can any other piece intervene.
     - This is checkmate.

   - **Other candidate moves:**
     - Ne4-g5+ allows the Black king to escape to h8, so it is not a mate in 1.
     - Ne4-f6+ also allows the Black king to escape to h8, so it is not a mate in 1.

4. **Verify that there is no earlier checkmate before move 1.**
   - The position is analyzed, and no other move delivers checkmate in fewer than 1 move.

**Conclusion:** The move 1. Rg4-g8# is a forced mate in 1.
