1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on d8 in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for White**:  
   The position suggests attacking moves involving White's queen, knights, and rook. The Black king is somewhat exposed, and White has strong attacking potential. Candidate moves include checks like Qh5+, Nf7+, and Ne6+.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 4 moves**:  
   Let's analyze the position systematically to find a forced mate in 4 moves.

   - **Move 1**: White plays 1. Qh5+, forcing Black's king to move to f8 (as g6 is covered by the knight on g5).  
   - **Move 2**: White plays 2. Nf7+, a discovered check from the queen. Black's king must move to g8 (as e8 is covered by the knight on e5).  
   - **Move 3**: White plays 3. Nh6+, forcing Black's king to move to h8 (as g7 is covered by the queen on h5).  
   - **Move 4**: White plays 4. Qf7#, delivering checkmate. The Black king is trapped, and no piece can block or capture the queen.

4. **Verify the solution**:  
   - Every move is legal.  
   - Checkmate is delivered on the 4th move.  
   - There is no earlier checkmate before move 4, as Black has forced responses to each check.
