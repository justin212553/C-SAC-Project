--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates that it is Black's turn to move ("b" in the FEN).
   - Black must deliver checkmate to the White king on g1.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has only one piece that can move: the rook on e4.
   - The rook can move along the e-file or the 4th rank. Possible moves include Re1, Re2, Re3, Re5, Re6, Re7, Re8, Rb4, Rc4, Rd4, Rf4, Rg4, and Rh4.

3. **Evaluate each candidate move:**
   - The goal is to deliver checkmate in exactly 1 move. This means the White king on g1 must be in check and unable to escape, with no legal moves for White to block or capture the checking piece.
   - Among the candidate moves, **Re1** is the most promising because it directly attacks the White king along the e-file.

4. **Verify Re1 as a checkmate:**
   - After 1...Re1, the White king on g1 is in check.
   - The White king cannot move to h1 or f1 because both squares are controlled by the Black rook.
   - The White pawns on f2, g2, and h2 cannot block the check or capture the rook.
   - Therefore, 1...Re1 is a legal move that delivers checkmate.

5. **Verify there is no earlier checkmate:**
   - Since it is Black's turn and the position requires mate in 1, no earlier checkmate is possible.
