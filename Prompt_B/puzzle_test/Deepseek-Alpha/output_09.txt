--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - White is to move, as indicated by "w" in the FEN string.
   - Black's king is on f8, and White must deliver checkmate in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has three pieces: the king on e6, the pawn on f6, and the pawn on f7.
   - The pawn on f7 is one square away from promotion, which could lead to a decisive move.
   - Candidate moves include promoting the pawn on f7 to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **Promoting f7 to a queen (f7=Q):**
     - This move places the queen on f7, directly attacking the Black king on f8.
     - The Black king has no legal moves because all adjacent squares (e8, e7, g8, g7) are either occupied or attacked by White's pieces.
     - This results in immediate checkmate.

   - **Promoting f7 to a rook (f7=R):**
     - Similar to the queen promotion, the rook on f7 attacks the Black king on f8.
     - The Black king has no legal moves, resulting in checkmate.

   - **Promoting f7 to a bishop (f7=B):**
     - The bishop on f7 does not deliver check, so this move fails to achieve checkmate.

   - **Promoting f7 to a knight (f7=N):**
     - The knight on f7 does not deliver check, so this move fails to achieve checkmate.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - Promoting the pawn on f7 to a queen (f7=Q) or rook (f7=R) results in checkmate in 1 move.
   - Promoting to a bishop or knight fails to deliver checkmate.
   - The fastest and most decisive move is f7=Q.
