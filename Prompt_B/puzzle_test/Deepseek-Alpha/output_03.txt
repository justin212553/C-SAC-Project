1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   - White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on g8 in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White**:  
   - White has the rook on e5 and the king on b4. The rook is the most likely piece to deliver checkmate since it can attack the Black king directly.  
   - Candidate moves for the rook: Re8+, Re7+, Re6+, and others.  
   - The White king on b4 cannot deliver checkmate directly, so it is not relevant for this task.

3. **Analyze each candidate move**:  
   - **Re8+**: This move places the Black king in check. The Black king on g8 has no legal moves because all adjacent squares (f8, h8, f7, g7, h7) are either occupied by Black pawns or controlled by the White rook. This is checkmate.  
   - **Re7+**: This move places the Black king in check, but the Black king can escape to h8. Therefore, it is not checkmate.  
   - **Re6+**: This move places the Black king in check, but the Black king can escape to h8. Therefore, it is not checkmate.  

4. **Verify the solution**:  
   - Re8+ is legal and delivers checkmate in exactly 1 move.  
   - No other move achieves checkmate in 1 move.
