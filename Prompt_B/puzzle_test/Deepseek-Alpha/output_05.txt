--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate:**
   - White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on a6 in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several pieces that can deliver checks: the rook on h7, the bishop on g4, and pawns on c5 and c4. The candidate moves are:
     - Rh6+
     - Rh8+
     - c5-c6+
     - c4-c5+
     - Bg4-d7+

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **Rh6+:** This move places the Black king in check. The Black king on a6 has no legal moves because all escape squares (b5, b6, b7, and a7) are controlled by White's pieces (rook, bishop, and pawns). This is checkmate.
   - **Rh8+:** This move does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.
   - **c5-c6+:** This move places the Black king in check, but the Black king can escape to b5. Therefore, it is not a mate in 1.
   - **c4-c5+:** This move does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.
   - **Bg4-d7+:** This move places the Black king in check, but the Black king can escape to b5. Therefore, it is not a mate in 1.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The move Rh6+ is legal, delivers check, and results in checkmate because the Black king has no escape squares. No other move achieves checkmate in exactly 1 move.
