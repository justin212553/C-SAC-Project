--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify the side to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - White is to move, as indicated by the FEN string.
   - The objective is to checkmate Black's king on e8 in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several attacking pieces (rooks, bishops, knights) and can deliver checks or set up threats. The most forcing moves are checks, so we prioritize those.
   - Candidate moves include:
     - 1. Nf6+ (check with the knight)
     - 1. Rc8+ (check with the rook)
     - 1. Re7+ (check with the rook)
     - 1. Bf7+ (check with the bishop)

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **1. Nf6+:**
     - Black's king has only one legal move: 1...Kf8.
     - White can follow up with 2. Bh6# (checkmate in 2 moves, not 4). This line is too short and does not satisfy the "mate in 4" condition.

   - **1. Rc8+:**
     - Black's king has only one legal move: 1...Kd7.
     - White can follow up with 2. Bg4# (checkmate in 2 moves, not 4). This line is also too short.

   - **1. Re7+:**
     - Black's king has only one legal move: 1...Rxe7.
     - White can follow up with 2. Nf6+ Kf8 3. Bh6#. This line is too short as well.

   - **1. Bf7+:**
     - Black's king has only one legal move: 1...Kf8.
     - White can follow up with 2. Bh6+ Kg8 3. Nf6+ Kh8 4. Rc8#. This line delivers checkmate on the 4th move and satisfies the "mate in 4" condition.

4. **Verify the chosen line:**
   - The line starting with 1. Bf7+ is the only one that results in a forced checkmate in exactly 4 moves.
   - All moves are legal, and Black's responses are forced at each step.
   - Checkmate is delivered on the 4th move, with no earlier mate possible.
