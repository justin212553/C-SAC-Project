--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   Black is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the White king in exactly 3 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for Black**:  
   Black has several options to deliver checks or set up threats. The most promising moves involve using the queen or rook to attack the White king or restrict its mobility.  

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 3 moves**:  
   - **Candidate move 1: 1... Qg3+**  
     This move forces White's king to move to h1 (the only legal square).  
     After 2. Kh1, Black can play 2... Qxh3+, forcing White to block with 3. Qh4.  
     Finally, Black delivers checkmate with 3... Qg2#.  

   - **Candidate move 2: 1... Rc1**  
     This move does not deliver immediate checks or threats and allows White to escape with moves like Qf5+. It does not lead to a forced mate in 3.  

   - **Candidate move 3: 1... Qg5**  
     This move does not deliver immediate checks and allows White to escape with moves like Qf3+. It does not lead to a forced mate in 3.  

4. **Verify the chosen line**:  
   The line starting with 1... Qg3+ is forced and leads to checkmate in exactly 3 moves.  
   - After 1... Qg3+, White's king is forced to move to h1.  
   - After 2... Qxh3+, White is forced to block with Qh4.  
   - After 3... Qg2#, the White king is checkmated.
