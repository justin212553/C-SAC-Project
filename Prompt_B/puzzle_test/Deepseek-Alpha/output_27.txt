--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify the side to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on h7 in exactly 3 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several checks available: Qg6+, Qc2+, and Qg8+. Among these, Qg6+ appears most forcing as it drives the Black king to a specific square.

3. **Analyze the candidate move Qg6+:**
   - After 1. Qg6+, Black's king has only one legal move: 1... Kh8.
   - White can then play 2. Qxh6+ to force the Black king back to h7 (2... Kh7).
   - Finally, White can deliver checkmate with 3. f8=Q#.

4. **Verify the line step by step:**
   - Move 1: 1. Qg6+ is legal and forces 1... Kh8.
   - Move 2: 2. Qxh6+ is legal and forces 2... Kh7.
   - Move 3: 3. f8=Q# is legal and delivers checkmate. The Black king is trapped on h7 with no escape squares, and no Black piece can block or capture the newly promoted queen.

5. **Confirm there is no earlier checkmate:**
   - White cannot deliver checkmate in fewer than 3 moves because the Black king has escape squares after the first check, and the forced sequence requires exactly 3 moves to trap the king.

6. **Conclude the best forced line:**
   - The sequence 1. Qg6+ Kh8 2. Qxh6+ Kh7 3. f8=Q# is a forced mate in 3.
