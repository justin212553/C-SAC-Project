1. **Side to move and target king**:  
   White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on c8 in exactly 4 moves.

2. **Initial position analysis**:  
   - Black's king is on c8, surrounded by pawns and pieces, with limited mobility.  
   - White has strong attacking pieces: the knight on e5, the knight on g5, and the bishop on a3.  
   - Black's pieces are mostly passive, and the queen on d7 is the main defender.  

3. **Candidate moves**:  
   White's first move should aim to create immediate threats while forcing Black into a defensive position. Promising candidates include:  
   - 1. Be6: A direct threat to the Black queen and king.  
   - 1. Nxd7: Captures the queen, but this does not lead to a forced mate in 4.  
   - 1. Nef7: A check that forces the Black king to move or the rook to block.  

4. **Concrete calculation of lines**:  
   - **Line A: 1. Be6**  
     1. Be6 Qxe6 (forced, as the queen is attacked)  
     2. Nxe6 dxe6 (forced, as the knight is attacking the king)  
     3. Nf7 Re8 (only move to delay mate)  
     4. Nd6# (checkmate).  

   - **Line B: 1. Nef7+**  
     1. Nef7+ Kb8 (forced, as the king must move)  
     2. Bd6 Qxd6 (forced, as the queen must capture the bishop)  
     3. Nxd6 cxd6 (forced, as the knight is attacking the king)  
     4. Bxd6# (checkmate).  

   - **Line C: 1. Nxd7**  
     This move captures the queen but does not lead to a forced mate in 4.  

5. **Verification**:  
   Both Line A and Line B result in checkmate on the 4th move. However, Line A (1. Be6) is more forcing and direct, as it immediately attacks the Black queen and king.
