1. **Side to move and target king**:  
   White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate Black's king on h8 in exactly 3 moves.

2. **Candidate moves**:  
   White has several attacking options, but the most forcing moves involve checks or threats to the Black king. The most promising candidates are:  
   - 1. Rxg6+ (forcing the Black king to move or the g6 pawn to capture).  
   - 1. Nxf6 (threatening mate on g8).  
   - 1. Bxf6+ (removing the g6 bishop and opening lines).  

3. **Analysis of candidate moves**:  
   - **1. Rxg6+**:  
     After 1... hxg6 (forced), White can play 2. Nxf6, threatening mate on g8. Black has no way to stop 3. Ng8#.  
     - 2... Rxf6 fails to 3. Bxf6#.  
     - 2... Rg8 fails to 3. Nxg8#.  
     This line delivers mate in exactly 3 moves.  

   - **1. Nxf6**:  
     This threatens mate on g8, but Black can defend with 1... Rxf6, delaying the mate beyond 3 moves.  

   - **1. Bxf6+**:  
     After 1... Rxf6, White cannot deliver mate in exactly 3 moves.  

4. **Verification**:  
   The line starting with 1. Rxg6+ is the only one that forces mate in exactly 3 moves, regardless of Black's responses.
