--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is White's turn to move ("w").
   - White must deliver checkmate to the Black king on g8.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several pieces that can potentially deliver check or checkmate: the knight on e4 and the rook on g4.
   - Candidate moves include:
     - Rg4-g8
     - Rg4-h4
     - Ne4-g5
     - Ne4-f6

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **1. Rg4-g8:** This move places the Black king on g8 in check. The Black king has no legal moves, and no other Black piece can block or capture the rook. This is checkmate.
   - **1. Rg4-h4:** This move does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.
   - **1. Ne4-g5:** This move does not deliver check, so it cannot be a mate in 1.
   - **1. Ne4-f6:** This move delivers check, but the Black king can escape to h8. Therefore, it is not a mate in 1.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The move 1. Rg4-g8 is legal and delivers checkmate. The Black king is in check, has no escape squares, and no Black piece can block or capture the rook. This satisfies the condition of a forced mate in 1.

5. **Confirm there is no earlier checkmate:**
   - Since it is White's turn and the position requires a mate in 1, no earlier move exists.
