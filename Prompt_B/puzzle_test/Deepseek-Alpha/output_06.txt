--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is Black's turn to move ("b").
   - Black must checkmate the White king, which is located on a3.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has several pieces that can potentially deliver check: the rook on h2, the bishop on g5, and pawns on c5 and c4.
   - The rook on h2 is particularly well-placed to deliver a decisive checkmate, as it can move to h3, attacking the White king directly.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 1 move:**
   - **Candidate move: 1... Rh3#**
     - The rook moves to h3, delivering check to the White king on a3.
     - The White king has no legal moves to escape the check:
       - The squares b4, b3, and b2 are all controlled by Black's pawns and bishop.
       - The square a4 is controlled by the Black pawn on c5.
       - The square a2 is controlled by the Black rook on h3.
     - There are no White pieces that can block the check or capture the attacking rook.
     - This is a forced checkmate in 1 move.

4. **Verify that no earlier checkmate exists:**
   - Black cannot deliver checkmate in 0 moves, as it is Black's turn to move.
   - No other move besides 1... Rh3 results in checkmate in exactly 1 move.

**Conclusion:** The best forced line is 1... Rh3#, delivering checkmate.
