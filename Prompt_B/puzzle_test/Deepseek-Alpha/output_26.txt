--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   Black is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the White king in exactly 3 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for Black**:  
   Black has several options to initiate the attack. The most promising moves involve using the queen or rook to deliver checks and force the White king into a vulnerable position. The goal is to set up a forced sequence leading to checkmate in 3 moves.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 3 moves**:  
   - **Candidate 1: 1... Qb3+**  
     This move forces the White king to move to a2 (the only legal move).  
     After 2... Rc2+, the White king is forced to move to b1.  
     Finally, 3... Qxb2# delivers checkmate.  

   - **Candidate 2: 1... Rc2+**  
     This move forces the White king to move to b1.  
     After 2... Qb3+, the White king is forced to move to a2.  
     Finally, 3... Qxb2# delivers checkmate.  

   Both lines result in checkmate in exactly 3 moves, but the move order differs.

4. **Verify legality and checkmate conditions**:  
   - Every move in the sequence is legal.  
   - Checkmate is delivered on the third move, with no earlier mate possible.  
   - The White king has no escape squares after the final move.

5. **Choose the best forced line**:  
   Both lines are equally valid, but the first candidate (starting with 1... Qb3+) is chosen for clarity.
