--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is White's turn to move ("w").
   - White must deliver checkmate to the Black king on a6 in exactly 2 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for White:**
   - White has several attacking pieces: the rook on e1, the rook on f2, and the pawn on c6.
   - Candidate moves include checks and preparatory moves that set up a forced mate in 2:
     - 1. Ra1+ (check with the rook on e1)
     - 1. Re5 (preparing to deliver mate with the rook on f2)
     - 1. c7 (advancing the pawn to threaten promotion)

3. **Analyze each candidate move:**
   - **1. Ra1+:**
     - Black's only legal move is 1... Kb5.
     - White can then play 2. Re5#, delivering checkmate. The Black king is trapped by its own pawns and White's rooks.
     - This line satisfies the requirement of mate in exactly 2 moves.

   - **1. Re5:**
     - This move does not deliver check or force Black into a specific response. Black can play 1... b3, and White cannot deliver mate on the second move. This line fails.

   - **1. c7:**
     - Advancing the pawn threatens promotion, but it does not deliver check or force Black into a specific response. Black can play 1... b3, and White cannot deliver mate on the second move. This line fails.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The move 1. Ra1+ forces Black's king to move to b5, and White can then deliver checkmate with 2. Re5#.
   - There is no earlier checkmate before move 2, and the solution is forced.
