--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate:**
   - The FEN indicates it is Black's turn to move ("b" in the FEN string).
   - Black must deliver checkmate to the White king, which is located on a3.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for Black:**
   - Black has two rooks (on e8 and f7) and a pawn (on c3) that can potentially contribute to the attack.
   - The White king is confined to the a-file and cannot escape easily due to the pawn on b5 and Black's pieces.
   - Candidate moves include checks with the rooks or advancing the c3 pawn.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 2 moves:**
   - **Candidate 1: 1... Ra8+**
     - White's king is forced to move to b4 (1. Ka4).
     - Black can then deliver checkmate with 2... Rfa7# (the rook on f7 moves to a7, trapping the king completely).
     - This line results in checkmate on the second move.

   - **Candidate 2: 1... Re2**
     - This move does not deliver a check and allows White to escape or defend. It is not forcing and does not lead to mate in 2.

   - **Candidate 3: 1... c2**
     - Advancing the pawn does not deliver a check and allows White to escape or defend. It is not forcing and does not lead to mate in 2.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - The line 1... Ra8+ followed by 2... Rfa7# is legal, forces White's king to move, and delivers checkmate on the second move.
   - There is no faster checkmate, and no other candidate move achieves mate in 2.
