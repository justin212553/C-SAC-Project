--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate**:  
   White is to move, and the goal is to checkmate the Black king on h8 in exactly 2 moves.

2. **List promising candidate moves for White**:  
   White has several attacking options, particularly involving the queen and rook. The most promising moves are checks, as they force Black's responses.  
   - Candidate moves: Qh5+, Qxf6+, Qe7+, and Rd4.

3. **Analyze each candidate move for a forced mate in 2**:  
   - **1. Qh5+**:  
     Black's king is forced to move to g8 (1... Kg8).  
     White can then deliver checkmate with 2. Qf7#.  
     This line works and satisfies the condition of mate in 2.  

   - **1. Qxf6+**:  
     Black can respond with 1... Kg8. White has no way to deliver checkmate on the second move. This line fails.  

   - **1. Qe7+**:  
     Black can block the check with 1... Rde8. White cannot deliver checkmate on the second move. This line fails.  

   - **1. Rd4**:  
     This move does not deliver check and allows Black to defend. It fails to meet the requirement of mate in 2.  

4. **Verify the best line**:  
   The sequence 1. Qh5+ Kg8 2. Qf7# is legal, forces Black's moves, and delivers checkmate on the second move. There is no faster mate, and no other candidate move achieves the objective.

[FINAL PGN]  
1. Qh5+ Kg8 2. Qf7#
