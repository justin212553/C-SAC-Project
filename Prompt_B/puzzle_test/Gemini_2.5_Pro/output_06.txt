This is a mate-in-1 puzzle. My goal is to find a single move for Black that results in an immediate checkmate of the White king.

1.  **Analyze the White King's Position:** The White king is on `a3`.
2.  **Identify Escape Squares:** Let's examine all the squares adjacent to the White king to see if it has any legal moves.
    *   `a2`: This square is attacked by the Black rook on `h2`.
    *   `a4`: This square is attacked by the Black pawn on `b5`.
    *   `b2`: This square is attacked by the Black rook on `h2`.
    *   `b3`: This square is attacked by the Black pawn on `c4`.
    *   `b4`: This square is attacked by the Black pawn on `c5`.
3.  **Conclusion on King Safety:** The White king has no legal moves. It is completely trapped. This means that any legal check delivered by Black will be checkmate, as the king cannot escape, the check cannot be blocked (if the checking piece is adjacent), and there are no other White pieces to capture the attacker.
4.  **Find a Checking Move:** I need to find a move for Black that puts the White king in check.
    *   The Black pawn on `b5` can move one square forward to `b4`.
    *   The move `...b4` attacks the White king on `a3`.
5.  **Verify Checkmate:**
    *   The move `1... b4` delivers check.
    *   As established in step 2, the king has no escape squares.
    *   The checking pawn on `b4` cannot be captured.
    *   The check cannot be blocked.
    *   Therefore, `1... b4` is checkmate.
