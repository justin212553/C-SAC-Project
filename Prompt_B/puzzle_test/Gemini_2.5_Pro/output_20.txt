This is a mate-in-2 problem for Black.

**1. Initial Analysis:**
The White king on b7 is severely restricted. Its potential escape squares are a8, a7, a6, and c6.
*   a8 is controlled by the White rook on c8.
*   a7 is controlled by the White pawn on b6.
*   a6 is controlled by the Black pawn on b5.
*   c6 is occupied by the Black knight.
The White king has no legal moves. This means any check that cannot be legally met (by capturing the checking piece or blocking the check) will be checkmate.

**2. Candidate Moves and Threats:**
Black's most obvious threat is based on the knight on c6.
*   `1... Na7#` is an immediate checkmate. Since the problem asks for a mate in exactly 2 moves, this cannot be the solution, and Black must make a non-checking "quiet" move first.
*   A quiet move by Black will set up a mating threat for the second move. The primary threat is `2... Na7#`.

**3. White's Defenses:**
White must use their turn to counter Black's threat. White has several defensive ideas:
*   **Positional Defenses:**
    1.  `Ra8` (from c8): This move prepares to capture the knight if it moves to a7 (`...Na7+; Rxa7`).
    2.  `Rc6` (from c8): This move vacates the c8 square, freeing the a8 square as an escape for the king (`...Na7+; Ka8`).
    3.  `Rxe7`: The White rook on e7 attacks the key Black knight on c6. Capturing it would remove the main threat.
*   **Delaying Checks:** White can give checks to force Black to respond, delaying the mate beyond two moves (e.g., `Re8+`, `c8=Q+`, `Qb2+`).

**4. Finding the Key Move:**
Black's first move must be one that ensures a checkmate on the next turn, regardless of which defense White chooses. Let's analyze the candidate moves for Black.

*   Many quiet moves like `1... Rd2`, `1... Rd3`, `1... b4`, etc., set up a dual threat. If White plays `2. Ra8` to stop `...Na7#`, Black can reply with `2... Na5#`. This is a double check from the knight and a discovered check from the queen. The king cannot move to any of its adjacent squares (a8 is occupied, a7 is guarded by the b6-pawn, a6 is guarded by the b5-pawn, and c6 is also guarded by the b5-pawn). This is a valid mating pattern.
*   However, these moves fail against `2. Rc6`, which allows the king to escape to a8 after `2... Na7+`. They also fail against White's delaying checks.

We need a move that handles all of White's defenses simultaneously. Let's consider the move `1... Rd4`.

**Step-by-step analysis of `1... Rd4`:**

*   This quiet move places the Black rook on d4. It cuts the White queen's access to b2, thus preventing the `Qb2+` check. It also creates a situation where all of White's other defenses fail.

Let's examine White's possible replies to `1... Rd4`:

*   **If White captures the knight:** `2. Rxe7`. This removes the primary attacking piece. However, Black has a new mate: `2... Rd7#`. The White king is checked and has no escape squares, and the rook on d7 cannot be captured.
*   **If White defends against `...Na7#` with `2. Ra8`:** Black delivers the double-check mate `2... Na5#`, as explained above. The king is trapped.
*   **If White tries to create an escape square with `2. Rc6`:** This move vacates c8, hoping to allow the king to escape to a8. However, Black simply plays the original threat: `2... Na7#`. The rook on c6 does not defend a7, and the king's escape to a8 is irrelevant as it is checkmate on the spot.
*   **If White tries a delaying check with `2. Re8+`:** Black interposes with `2... Rd8`. This move is not only a block but also a checkmate! The White king on b7 is now attacked by the rook on d8. The king has no escape squares, the rook cannot be captured, and the check cannot be blocked. So, `2... Rd8#`.
*   **If White tries another check with `2. c8=Q+`:** Black captures with `2... Rxc8`. This move is also checkmate. The king is checked by the rook, has no escape squares, and the rook cannot be captured. So, `2... Rxc8#`.
*   **If White plays any other quiet move** (e.g., `2. h7`, `2. Re1`, `2. Qf1`): Black delivers the primary threat, `2... Na7#`.

The move `1... Rd4` successfully addresses every possible defense White has, leading to a forced checkmate on Black's second move.
