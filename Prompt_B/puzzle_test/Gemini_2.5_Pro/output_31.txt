This is a mate-in-4 problem. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to find the solution:

1.  **Initial Analysis:** White is to move. The Black king on h8 is severely restricted. Its own pawns on h7 and g6, along with the pinned f7-pawn, create a cage. The White bishop on c5 is a monster, pinning the g7-pawn and controlling key squares around the king. The White rook on a1 can swing over to the back rank to launch a decisive attack. Black's only active piece is the rook on c2, but it's not involved in the defense of the king. The knight on g8 is the king's sole guardian.

2.  **Identifying the Key Move:** The most forcing and promising move for White is `1. Ra8+`. This check immediately forces Black's hand and initiates the mating sequence. Black has two legal responses: interposing with the knight (`1... Nf8`) or moving the king (`1... Kg7`).

3.  **Analyzing Black's Defenses:**

    *   **Case A: Black plays `1... Nf8`**
        This is Black's primary defense. The knight blocks the check but also blocks the f8 escape square for its own king.
        *   `2. Rxf8+`: White must remove this key defender. This exchange sacrifice is decisive.
        *   `2... Kg7`: This is the only legal move for the Black king.
        *   `3. Rg8+`: White continues with another check, using the newly positioned rook to drive the king into a mating net.
        *   `3... Kh6`: Again, Black has only one legal move. The king is forced to h6.
        *   `4. Bf8#`: This is the final move. The bishop delivers checkmate. The king on h6 is attacked and has no escape squares: g7 is covered by the rook on g8, h7 is blocked by a pawn, h5 is covered by the bishop on f8, and g5 is covered by the pawn on e4.

    *   **Case B: Black plays `1... Kg7`**
        The king tries to escape via g7.
        *   `2. Ra7+`: White continues to hound the king with checks.
        *   `2... Kh6`: This is the most stubborn defense (moves like `2... Kf8` or `2... Kh8` lead to mate even faster, e.g., `2... Kf8 3. Rf7+ Kg8 4. Rg7#`).
        *   `3. Rh7+`: Another check, forcing the king further out.
        *   `3... Kg5`: The only legal move.
        *   `4. h4#`: The pawn delivers a beautiful checkmate, with all escape squares covered by White's rooks and pawns.

4.  **Conclusion:** Both of Black's main responses to `1. Ra8+` lead to a forced checkmate in exactly 4 moves. The line beginning with `1... Nf8` is chosen for the final answer as it involves more forced moves for Black.
