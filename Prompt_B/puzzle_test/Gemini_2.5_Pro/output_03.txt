This is a mate-in-1 puzzle. My goal is to find a single move for White that results in an immediate checkmate of the Black king.

1.  **Analyze the position of the Black King:** The Black king is on g8. It is surrounded by its own pawns on f7, g7, and h7. This means it cannot move to any of these squares. The only potential escape squares are on the 8th rank: f8 and h8.

2.  **Identify White's attacking piece:** White's only piece that can attack the Black king is the Rook on e5.

3.  **Formulate a plan:** I need to move the Rook to a square where it attacks the king on g8 and also controls the king's only escape squares, f8 and h8.

4.  **Evaluate candidate moves:**
    *   Moving the Rook along the e-file: If I play 1. Re8+, the Rook attacks the king on g8. It also controls the entire 8th rank, including the squares f8 and h8. The king cannot move to f7, g7, or h7 because of its own pawns. The check cannot be blocked, and the Rook on e8 cannot be captured. This is checkmate.
    *   Moving the Rook along the 5th rank: If I play a move like 1. Rg5+, the king is in check, but it can simply escape to h8. The same is true for any other check along the 5th rank.

5.  **Conclusion:** The only move that delivers checkmate is moving the Rook to e8.
