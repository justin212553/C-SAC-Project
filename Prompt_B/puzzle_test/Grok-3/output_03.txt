--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
   - The 'w' in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - The goal is to checkmate the Black king, which is currently on g8.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - White's pieces are a king on b4 and a rook on e5.
   - Since it's a mate in 1, I need to find a move that immediately delivers checkmate to the Black king on g8.
   - The rook on e5 can move along the e-file or the 5th rank. Possible moves to consider are those that attack the Black king directly or restrict its movement.
   - The Black king is on g8, surrounded by its pawns on f7, g7, and h7, which limits its escape squares.
   - Candidate moves for the rook:
     - Re8: Moves the rook to the 8th rank, directly attacking the king’s rank.
     - Other rook moves like Rh5, Rg5, etc., to see if they can deliver checkmate.
   - The White king on b4 is not in a position to contribute directly to a mate in 1, so I’ll focus on the rook.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since it's mate in 1, there is no response from Black; the move must be checkmate immediately.
   - Let’s evaluate Re8:
     - Move the rook from e5 to e8.
     - This places the rook on the same rank as the Black king (8th rank).
     - Check if this is check: Yes, the rook on e8 directly attacks the king on g8 along the 8th rank, so it’s check (Re8+).
     - Check if the Black king can escape:
       - The king on g8 can try to move to f8, g7, or h8.
       - f8 is blocked by the Black pawn on f7.
       - g7 is blocked by the Black pawn on g7.
       - h8 is blocked by the Black pawn on h7.
       - Therefore, the king has no legal moves to escape the check.
     - Check if any other Black piece can block the check or capture the rook:
       - Black has only pawns on f7, g7, and h7, and none of them can move to the 8th rank to block the check (pawns can’t move sideways or backward).
       - No Black piece can capture the rook on e8.
     - Therefore, Re8+ is checkmate.
   - Let’s briefly check another move, say Rh5:
     - Rook moves to h5, attacking along the 5th rank and h-file.
     - This does not attack the king on g8 directly (no check).
     - Therefore, it’s not checkmate.
   - Similarly, other rook moves like Rg5 or Rf5 do not deliver check to the king on g8, as they are not on the same rank or file as the king without obstruction.

4. **At each step, explicitly verify that:**
   - **Every move is legal:**
     - Re8 is a legal move; the rook can move from e5 to e8 as there are no pieces in between.
   - **Checkmate is delivered on the final move:**
     - As analyzed, Re8+ puts the Black king in check, and the king has no escape squares, nor can any piece block or capture the rook. Thus, it’s checkmate.
   - **There is no earlier checkmate before move 1:**
     - Since it’s White’s turn to move, and the position before White’s move does not have Black in checkmate (the rook is on e5, not attacking the king yet), there is no checkmate before move 1.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line for mate in 1 is the move Re8, which delivers checkmate immediately as the Black king cannot escape, and no Black piece can intervene.
