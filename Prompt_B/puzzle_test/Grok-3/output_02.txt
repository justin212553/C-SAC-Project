--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1
   - The lowercase 'b' at the end of the FEN string indicates that Black is to move.
   - The goal is to deliver checkmate to the White king, as Black is the attacking side.
   - From the FEN, the White king is on h8, the Black king is on f8, the Black queen is on f7, the Black knight is on g7, and the Black bishop is on g6.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (Black).**
   - Since the objective is mate in 1 move, I need to find a single move by Black that immediately results in checkmate.
   - Let's examine the position:
     - White king on h8 is on the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to mating patterns.
     - Black has a queen on f7, a knight on g7, and a bishop on g6, all near the White king.
     - Possible moves to consider are those that directly attack the White king or cut off escape squares.
   - Candidate moves:
     - Queen moves: Qf7-h5 (attacking along the h-file), Qf7-g8 (attacking along the 8th rank), Qf7-e8 (potentially cutting off escape), etc.
     - Knight moves: Ng7-h5, Ng7-f5, etc.
     - Bishop moves: Bg6-h5, Bg6-f5, etc.
   - Since it's mate in 1, the move must immediately put the White king in check with no legal moves to escape.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move.**
   - I will test the most promising moves one by one to see if they deliver checkmate.
   - **Candidate 1: Qf7-h5**
     - Move the queen from f7 to h5.
     - Is this legal? Yes, there are no pieces blocking the path from f7 to h5.
     - Does this put the White king in check? Yes, the queen on h5 directly attacks h8 along the h-file.
     - Can the White king escape? The White king on h8 has potential escape squares on g8 and h7.
       - g8 is attacked by the Black knight on g7 (knight controls g8).
       - h7 is attacked by the Black queen on h5 (queen controls the h-file).
     - Are there any other White pieces that can block the check or capture the queen? No, White has no other pieces on the board.
     - Therefore, Qh5 is checkmate because the king is in check and has no legal moves to escape, and no other White pieces can intervene.
   - Since the problem specifies mate in exactly 1 move, and I’ve found a move that achieves checkmate immediately, I can stop here without needing to explore other candidates. However, for thoroughness, I’ll briefly check if other moves also work.
   - **Candidate 2: Qf7-g8**
     - Queen to g8 puts the king in check along the 8th rank.
     - Escape squares: h7 is not attacked by any Black piece (only h5 is covered by the queen if it were there, but it's on g8 now), so the king can move to h7.
     - Not checkmate.
   - **Candidate 3: Ng7-h5**
     - Knight to h5 does not put the king in check (knight on h5 attacks g7 and f6, not h8).
     - Not checkmate.
   - **Candidate 4: Bg6-h5**
     - Bishop to h5 does not put the king in check (bishop on h5 attacks along diagonals, not h8 directly).
     - Not checkmate.
   - From this, only Qf7-h5 delivers checkmate in 1 move.

4. **Verify the conditions explicitly.**
   - **Is the move legal?** Yes, Qf7-h5 is a legal move for the Black queen.
   - **Is checkmate delivered on the final move (move 1)?** Yes, after Qh5, the White king is in check and has no escape squares (g8 is controlled by the knight on g7, h7 is controlled by the queen on h5), and there are no other White pieces to block or capture.
   - **Is there an earlier checkmate before move 1?** No, since Black is moving first in this position, and the problem starts with Black to move, there is no prior move to consider for an earlier mate.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line for Black to deliver checkmate in exactly 1 move is Qf7-h5. This move immediately results in checkmate as the White king has no escape squares and no way to block or capture the attacking piece.
