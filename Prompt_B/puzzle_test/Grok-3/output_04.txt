--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1
   - The 'b' in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - The objective is to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 1 move.
   - From the FEN, the White king is on g1, and the Black king is on b5, with a Black rook on e4. White has pawns on f2, g2, and h2.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - Since Black is to move and we need a checkmate in 1 move, I will look for moves that directly attack the White king on g1 and prevent any escape or defense.
   - The Black rook on e4 is a key piece, as rooks can control ranks and files effectively. Possible moves for the rook include:
     - Re1: Moving the rook to the 1st rank, directly attacking the White king on g1.
     - Other rook moves along the e-file or 4th rank might not directly threaten checkmate.
   - The Black king on b5 is less likely to contribute to an immediate checkmate in 1 move, as it is far from the White king and cannot deliver check directly.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since the goal is checkmate in 1 move, Black must deliver checkmate immediately with their move, and White does not get a chance to respond.
   - Candidate move: Re1
     - Move the Black rook from e4 to e1.
     - This places the rook on the 1st rank, directly attacking the White king on g1.
     - Check if this is check: Yes, the rook on e1 attacks g1 along the 1st rank, and there are no pieces blocking the path, so it is check.
     - Check if the White king can escape:
       - The White king on g1 can potentially move to f1, g2, or h1.
       - f1 is attacked by the rook on e1 (along the 1st rank).
       - g2 is attacked by the rook on e1 (since the rook controls the g-file after moving to e1? No, correction: the rook on e1 controls the 1st rank and the e-file, not the g-file. Let me re-evaluate the escape squares.)
       - g2: The rook on e1 does not attack g2, as g2 is on a different rank and file. However, g2 is occupied by a White pawn (from the FEN), so the king cannot move to g2 because it is blocked by its own pawn.
       - h1: The rook on e1 attacks h1 along the 1st rank, so h1 is also under attack.
       - Therefore, the king has no legal moves: f1 and h1 are attacked by the rook, and g2 is occupied by a White pawn.
     - Check if White can block the check or capture the rook:
       - There are no White pieces (other than the king and pawns) on the board. The pawns on f2, g2, and h2 cannot move to e1 to capture the rook or block the check on the 1st rank (pawns cannot move backward or sideways to block).
       - Thus, there is no way for White to block the check or capture the rook.
     - Conclusion: Re1 delivers checkmate because the White king is in check, has no escape squares, and White cannot block or capture the attacking piece.
   - Other candidate moves (e.g., moving the rook elsewhere or moving the Black king) do not deliver immediate checkmate:
     - Moving the rook to e2, e3, etc., does not attack the White king directly.
     - Moving the Black king (e.g., to a5, b6, etc.) does not attack the White king or contribute to checkmate.

4. **At each step, explicitly verify that:**
   - **Every move is legal:**
     - Re1 is a legal move. The rook can move from e4 to e1 as there are no pieces blocking the path on the e-file.
   - **Checkmate is delivered on the final move:**
     - As analyzed, Re1 places the White king in check with no escape squares (f1 and h1 are attacked, g2 is blocked), and no way to block or capture the rook. Thus, it is checkmate on move 1.
   - **There is no earlier checkmate before move 1:**
     - Since Black is to move and the position starts with Black's turn, there is no prior move to consider. The checkmate occurs exactly on move 1 as required.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line is the move Re1, which delivers checkmate in exactly 1 move. No other move achieves this goal.
