--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN string provided is: 1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1
   - The 'w' in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - Therefore, White must deliver checkmate to the Black king in exactly 2 moves.
   - From the FEN, the Black king is on c2 (1st rank, c-file).

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (White).**
   - I will examine White's pieces and look for moves that either deliver check or set up a decisive threat.
   - White's key pieces are:
     - King on b8
     - Rook on d8
     - Queen on d4
     - Knights on b4 and c3
     - Pawns on a5, b7, c7, d3, f7, g7, h7
   - Black's king on c2 is somewhat exposed, with limited escape squares due to surrounding pawns and pieces (pawns on b3, a4, and Black's own pieces blocking some paths).
   - Promising moves for White could involve the queen or rook delivering a check or creating a threat that forces a response leading to mate.
   - Candidate moves to consider:
     - Queen moves to deliver check (e.g., Qd5+, Qe5+, Qxf3+).
     - Rook moves to attack or control key squares (e.g., Rd2+).
     - Pawn promotions or pawn moves to open lines or threaten promotion (e.g., b8=Q or c8=Q).
   - I will prioritize moves that give check or directly threaten the king, as they force Black to respond.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 2 moves, assuming reasonable defensive moves by Black.**
   - **Candidate 1: Qxf3+**
     - Move 1: Qxf3+ (capturing the Black queen on f3 and giving check).
     - Black's king on c2 has possible escape squares: b1, b2, d1, d2 (since c1 is occupied by Black's rook, and c3 is occupied by White's knight).
     - Let's check each response:
       - If Black plays Kxb2 (capturing White's knight on b2):
         - Move 2: White can play Qe2#. This is checkmate because the Black king on b2 is attacked by the queen on e2, and escape squares are blocked (a1 is out of reach, b1 is attacked by White's knight on b4, c1 has Black's rook, c2 is attacked by White's knight on c3, a3 and c3 are occupied or attacked). However, b3 is a potential escape square (pawn on b3 is Black's, but king can't move there due to knight on b4 controlling it? No, b3 is not controlled by White's pieces directly, but let's confirm: king on b2 to b3 is illegal as b3 has Black's pawn. So escape squares are limited. Actually, b1 is the issue: White's knight on b4 does not attack b1 (knight on b4 attacks a2, c2, etc., but not b1). So Black king on b2 can move to b1. Thus, Qe2 is not checkmate. This line fails.
       - If Black plays Kd1:
         - Move 2: White can try Qe2, but Black king can move to d2 or c1 (c1 is occupied by Black's rook, so only d2). But d2 is attacked by White's knight on c3. Knight on c3 attacks d1 and b1, not d2. So king to d2 escapes. This line fails.
     - This move does not guarantee mate in 2.
   - **Candidate 2: Qd5+**
     - Move 1: Qd5+ (queen moves to d5, giving check to Black king on c2).
     - Black's king escape squares: b1, b2, d1, d2.
       - If Black plays Kxb2:
         - Move 2: White plays Qd2#. Queen on d2 attacks b2, and Black king has no escape (b1 is not attacked by queen on d2, but White's knight on b4 attacks a2 and c2, not b1. However, b3 is occupied by Black's pawn, a1 is out of reach, c1 has Black's rook, c3 has White's knight. But b1 is still open. Queen on d2 does not attack b1, so king can move to b1. This is not checkmate. Fails.
     - This move does not work.
   - **Candidate 3: Rd2+**
     - Move 1: Rd2+ (rook moves to d2, giving check to Black king on c2).
     - Black's king escape squares: b1, b2, d1.
       - If Black plays Kxb2:
         - Move 2: White plays Qd3#. Queen on d3 attacks b2, and now check escape squares: b1 is attacked by White's knight on b4 (knight on b4 attacks a2, c2, a6, c6, d5, d3—yes, d3 attacks b2 indirectly, but king on b2 is attacked by queen on d3, and b1 is not attacked by queen on d3, but knight on b4 does not attack b1. Knight on b4 attacks: a2, c2, a6, c6, d5, d3. So b1 is not attacked. But b3 is occupied by Black's pawn, so king can't go there. However, b1 is still open. I need to recheck.
         - Actually, knight on b4 to d3 is a move, but in terms of control, knight on b4 controls squares two away in L-shape: so from b4, it controls a2, c2, d3, d5, a6, c6. So it attacks c2, which is where king was, but not b1. However, White also has knight on c3, which attacks b1 and d1. Knight on c3 moves to b1, d1, a4, e4, etc. So knight on c3 attacks b1. So if Black king moves to b2, and White plays Qd3#, king on b2 can't move to b1 because White's knight on c3 attacks b1. Also, b3 is occupied by Black's pawn, a1 is out of reach, c1 has Black's rook, c3 has White's knight. So no escape squares. Qd3# is checkmate.
       - If Black plays Kd1:
         - Move 2: White plays Qe3#. Queen on e3 attacks d1, and Black king has no escape: c1 has Black's rook, c2 is attacked by White's knight on b4, d2 is attacked by White's rook on d2, e1 is out of reach, e2 is attacked by White's rook on d2. Knight on b4 attacks c2 and d3, so c2 is covered. Knight on c3 attacks b1 and d1 (but king is on d1, already attacked by queen). Squares around d1: c1 (occupied), c2 (attacked by knight on b4), d2 (attacked by rook on d2), e2 (not directly attacked by queen on e3, but rook on d2 controls d-file partially, but e2 is not on d-file). Queen on e3 attacks d1, e2, f3, etc. So e2 is attacked by queen on e3. So king on d1 can't move to e2. All squares are covered or occupied. So Qe3# is checkmate.
       - If Black plays Kb1:
         - Move 2: White plays Qb6#. Queen on b6 attacks b1, and Black king has no escape: a1 and c1 are occupied or out of reach, b2 is attacked by White's knight on c3 (knight on c3 attacks b1 and d1, but also b2 is in range? No, knight on c3 attacks a2, b1, d1, e2, etc., not b2 directly. But knight on b4 attacks a2, c2, d3, etc., so b2 is not directly attacked by knights. However, queen on b6 attacks b-file, so b2 is attacked by queen. Also, c2 is attacked by knight on b4. So king on b1 can't move to b2 or c2. All escape squares blocked. Qb6# is checkmate.
     - So in all cases (Kxb2, Kd1, Kb1), White delivers mate on move 2.

4. **Verify legality, checkmate on final move, and no earlier mate.**
   - Move 1: Rd2+ is legal (rook moves from d8 to d2, no pieces in between, and it gives check to Black king on c2).
   - Black's responses are forced to move the king (since it's check), and in all cases (Kxb2, Kd1, Kb1), White's second move (Qd3#, Qe3#, Qb6# respectively) delivers checkmate as analyzed above.
   - There is no mate on move 1 because Rd2+ is only check, not checkmate (Black king has escape squares).
   - Thus, this is a forced mate in exactly 2 moves.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line is starting with Rd2+, leading to checkmate on the second move regardless of Black's response.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Rd2+ Kxb2 2. Qd3#
