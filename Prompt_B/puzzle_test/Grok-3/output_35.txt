--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 8/1Q4R1/p3q2p/5ppk/8/4P1PP/2r5/6K1 w - - 0 1
   - The 'w' in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - The goal is to deliver checkmate to the Black king, which is currently on h5, in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (White).**
   - White has a queen on b7 and a rook on g7, both of which are powerful pieces positioned near the Black king on h5.
   - The Black king is somewhat exposed on h5, with limited escape squares due to White's pawns on g3 and h3, and Black's own pawns on g5 and h6 restricting movement.
   - Potential first moves for White should focus on delivering a check or restricting the Black king's movement further. Let's consider moves that give check or threaten immediate danger:
     - Qb7-h7+: This moves the queen to h7, giving check to the Black king on h5.
     - Rg7-h7+: This moves the rook to h7, also giving check to the Black king on h5.
     - Qb7-f7+: This moves the queen to f7, giving check and attacking along the 7th rank.
   - Other moves like pushing pawns or moving the king seem less relevant for a quick checkmate.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 4 moves, assuming reasonable defensive moves by Black.**
   - I will analyze each candidate move step by step, ensuring the sequence is exactly 4 moves long (2 moves by White and 2 by Black), and that checkmate occurs on the 4th move (White's second move).

   **Candidate 1: Qb7-h7+**
   - Move 1: Qh7+ (White checks the Black king on h5).
     - Legal: Yes, the queen can move from b7 to h7, and it attacks the king on h5.
     - Black's possible responses:
       - Kh5-g6: Moves the king to g6, attacked by the queen on h7.
       - Kh5-h4: Moves the king to h4, closer to White's pawns.
   - Let's try Black's response Kh5-g6:
     - Move 2: Black plays Kg6.
     - Move 3: White needs to continue the attack. Possible moves include Qh7xg6+ (capturing the pawn and giving check).
       - Qxg6+: Legal, as the queen captures the pawn on g6 and checks the king.
       - Black's response: Kg6-h5 (only legal move, as other squares are blocked or attacked).
     - Move 4: White plays Qh7+ (queen to h7, checking the king on h5).
       - However, after Qxg6+ and Kg6-h5, White's queen is on g6, so moving to h7 is not possible. I miscalculated the position. Let me correct this.
       - After Qh7+ Kg6, White can play Rh7 (rook to h7), but let's see the correct follow-up.
       - Actually, after Qh7+ Kg6, White can play Qh8+ (queen to h8, check), forcing Kg6-f5 (only move), then White plays Qh7+ again, but this is not leading to mate in 4 as it repeats positions or takes longer.
   - This line seems problematic. Let's try Black's other response, Kh5-h4:
     - Move 2: Black plays Kh4.
     - Move 3: White can play Qh8+ (queen to h8, check), forcing Kg4 (only legal move due to White's pawn on h3).
     - Move 4: White plays Qg7# (queen to g7, checkmate, as the king on g4 is attacked and cannot escape due to White's pawns on g3 and h3, and Black's pawn on g5).
     - Sequence: 1. Qh7+ Kh4 2. Qh8+ Kg4 3. Qg7# (but this is only 3 moves total, not 4 moves as required—2 by White, 1 by Black. I miscounted; in chess, "mate in 4 moves" means 4 total moves, i.e., 2 by White and 2 by Black if White starts).
     - Correction: "Mate in 4" typically means White makes the 4th move to deliver mate, so total 7 plies (4 White, 3 Black), but problem specifies "exactly 4 moves," which I interpret as 4 total moves (2 White, 2 Black).
     - Problem statement: "mate in 4 moves (no faster, no slower)"—I believe this means 4 total moves in the sequence (2 White, 2 Black).
     - In my line above, Qh7+ Kh4 Qh8+ Kg4 Qg7# is only 5 plies (3 White moves), which is faster than intended. So this doesn't fit "exactly 4 moves."

   **Clarification of "mate in 4 moves":**
   - Upon re-reading, "mate in 4 moves" likely means White delivers mate on their 4th move (total 7 plies: 4 White, 3 Black), as is standard in chess problems unless specified as "4 moves total."
   - However, the problem explicitly says "exactly 4 moves," and in context, it may mean 4 total moves (2 White, 2 Black). I will test both interpretations.
   - Looking at the position, mate seems possible quickly, so let's assume "4 moves" means total 4 moves (2 White, 2 Black) as a first interpretation.

   **Candidate 2: Rg7-h7+**
   - Move 1: Rh7+ (White rook to h7, check).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - Black responses: Kg6 or Kh4.
   - If Black plays Kg6:
     - Move 2: Kg6.
     - Move 3: White plays Qf7+ (queen to f7, check).
     - Black must play Kf5 (only legal move).
     - Move 4: White plays Qe6# (queen to e6, mate, as king on f5 is trapped by Black's pawns and White's pieces).
     - Sequence: 1. Rh7+ Kg6 2. Qf7+ Kf5 3. Qe6# (again, only 3 White moves, total 5 plies, not fitting "exactly 4 moves" if interpreted as total 4).
   - I need to adjust my understanding. Let's assume "mate in 4 moves" means White's 4th move delivers mate (total 7 plies).

   **Reinterpretation: Mate in 4 moves means White mates on move 4 (7 plies).**
   - Let's try to find a sequence where White mates on their 4th move.
   - Start with Qb7-f7+ (queen to f7, check).
     - Move 1: Qf7+ (legal, checks king on h5).
     - Black responses: Kg6 or Kh4.
     - If Black plays Kg6:
       - Move 2: Kg6.
       - Move 3: White plays Qe6+ (queen to e6, check).
       - Black plays Kf5 (only move).
       - Move 5: White plays Qd5+ (queen to d5, check).
       - Black plays Ke6 (or Kg6).
       - Move 7: If Ke6, White plays Qd7# (mate, as king is trapped).
       - Sequence: 1. Qf7+ Kg6 2. Qe6+ Kf5 3. Qd5+ Ke6 4. Qd7# (this is 4 White moves, total 7 plies, and mates on move 4).
     - Check if mate is forced and no earlier mate:
       - After 1. Qf7+ Kg6, no immediate mate.
       - After 2. Qe6+ Kf5, no mate yet.
       - After 3. Qd5+ Ke6, no mate yet; Qd7# on move 4 delivers mate.
     - Verify Black's alternatives:
       - After 3. Qd5+, if Black plays Kg6, then 4. Qe6# (mate, as king on g6 is attacked, no escape due to pawns).
       - So, mate on move 4 regardless of Black's choice on move 3.
     - Check other Black responses earlier:
       - After 1. Qf7+, if Black plays Kh4, then 2. Qh7+ Kg4 3. Qh8+ Kf5 4. Qh7# (mate, king on f5 attacked, no escape).
       - In this line, after 2. Qh7+ Kg4, White could play 3. Qg7# (mate in 3 White moves), which is faster than required.
       - Problem specifies "no faster, no slower," so this line fails because mate can be delivered earlier.

   **Adjust Candidate Move to Avoid Early Mate**
   - Since Qf7+ allows a faster mate if Black plays Kh4, let's try a move that doesn't allow an early mate.
   - Try starting with a non-check move or a different approach, but pieces are limited.
   - Let's try Rg7-g6 (not check, but restricts king).
     - Move 1: Rg6 (legal).
     - Black can respond with various moves, e.g., Qe7 (attacking queen), or king move, or Rc5.
     - If Black plays Kh4, White can play Qh7+ Kg4 Qh8+ Kf5 Qh7#, but again, possible early mate.
   - This is getting complex. Let's stick to forcing lines.

   **Correct Line with Qf7+ and Force the Longer Path**
   - I realize I need a line where Black's responses don't allow mate before move 4.
   - After testing, let's finalize with Qf7+ and assume Black plays Kg6 (not Kh4, as Kh4 allows faster mate, but problem likely assumes best defense to delay mate).
   - In chess problems, "mate in 4" assumes Black defends to delay mate as long as possible.
   - So, sequence: 1. Qf7+ Kg6 (not Kh4, as Kh4 leads to mate in 3) 2. Qe6+ Kf5 3. Qd5+ Ke6 4. Qd7# (or if Kg6, Qe6#).
   - This fits "mate in 4 moves" as White's 4th move delivers mate, and no earlier mate is forced if Black plays Kg6.

4. **Conclude by choosing the best forced line.**
   - The line starting with Qf7+ leads to mate in exactly 4 White moves when Black defends optimally with Kg6.
   - Sequence: 1. Qf7+ Kg6 2. Qe6+ Kf5 3. Qd5+ Ke6 4. Qd7# (or Kg6 4. Qe6#).
   - All moves are legal, mate is delivered on move 4, and no earlier mate is forced with best defense.
