--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN string provided is: `bn2k3/2R2r2/1p1p4/3N2BB/4P3/2P3PP/r4r2/R3n2K w - - 0 1`
   - The 'w' in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - Therefore, White must deliver checkmate to the Black king in exactly 4 moves.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (White).**
   - First, let's assess the position by identifying key pieces and potential threats.
   - White has a strong attacking force near the Black king on e8, including:
     - Two rooks (on c7 and a1),
     - Two bishops (on g5 and h5),
     - A knight on d5.
   - Black's king is on e8, with limited escape squares due to White's control over key files and diagonals.
   - Black has defensive pieces (rooks on f7 and a2, knight on e1, bishop on b8), but they are somewhat disconnected.
   - Promising ideas for White include:
     - Delivering checks with the rooks or bishops to force the Black king to move.
     - Using the knight on d5 to create threats or forks.
     - Coordinating pieces to trap the Black king, potentially on f8 or another square.
   - Candidate moves to start with:
     - **Rg7+**: Rook to g7, delivering check along the g-file.
     - **Rxh7+**: Capturing the pawn on h7 with check (though there is no pawn on h7, so this is invalid; I misread initially).
     - **Bh6+**: Bishop to h6, delivering check.
     - **Nf6+**: Knight to f6, delivering check and attacking the king directly.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 4 moves, assuming reasonable defensive moves by Black.**
   - I will analyze each candidate move systematically to find a forced mate in 4, ensuring no mate occurs before move 4.
   - **Candidate 1: Rg7+**
     - Move 1: White plays Rg7+, checking the Black king on e8.
     - Black's king has only one legal move: Kf8 (since e7 is controlled by the White knight on d5, and d7/d8 are blocked or controlled).
     - Move 2: After Black plays Kf8, White can play Rf7+, attacking the king again with the rook.
     - Black's king must move back to e8 (only legal move, as f7 is occupied by White's rook, and other squares are blocked or controlled).
     - Move 3: White plays Rxf2+, capturing Black's rook on f2 with check.
     - Black's king moves to d8 (only legal move, as e7 is controlled by the knight, and other squares are blocked).
     - Move 4: White needs a checkmating move. Let's see available pieces:
       - White's knight on d5 can move to c7, but Nc7+ is not checkmate as Black's king can escape to c8.
       - White's bishop on g5 can move to f6, but Bf6+ is not checkmate (king escapes to c7).
       - White's rook on a1 has no clear path to deliver mate.
     - This line does not seem to work for mate on move 4. Let's abandon it for now.
   - **Candidate 2: Nf6+**
     - Move 1: White plays Nf6+, checking the Black king on e8.
     - Black's king must move to f8 (only legal move, as e7 is controlled by the knight after Nf6, and d7/d8 are blocked or unsafe).
     - Move 2: White needs a follow-up. Let's try Bh6+, delivering another check.
     - Black's king must move to e8 (only legal move, as f7 is blocked by Black's rook, and g8 is controlled by White's pieces).
     - Move 3: White plays Rg7+, checking again.
     - Black's king moves to d8 (only legal move, as e7 is unsafe due to White's control).
     - Move 4: White needs to deliver mate. Let's check:
       - Knight on f6 can move to e7 (Ne7+), but Black's king can escape to c8.
       - No immediate mate is apparent.
     - This line also fails to deliver mate on move 4.
   - **Candidate 3: Bh6+**
     - Move 1: White plays Bh6+, checking the Black king on e8.
     - Black's king must move to f8 (only legal move).
     - Move 2: White plays Rg7+, checking again.
     - Black's king must move to e8 (only legal move, as f7 is blocked by Black's rook).
     - Move 3: White plays Rxf7+, capturing the rook on f7 with check.
     - Black's king must move to d8 (only legal move).
     - Move 4: Now, White's knight on d5 can move to c7, delivering Nc7#. Let's verify:
       - King on d8, attacked by knight on c7.
       - Escape squares: c8 is not attacked directly by White's pieces, so the king can move to c8. This is not checkmate.
     - This line fails.
   - At this point, I realize I may have missed a key idea. Let's reconsider the position and try a different approach, focusing on forcing the king to a specific square.
   - **New Candidate: Rxf7+ (capturing the rook on f7 with check)**
     - Move 1: White plays Rxf7+, checking the Black king on e8.
     - Black's king must move to d8 (only legal move, as e7 is controlled by the knight on d5, f8 is controlled by the bishop on h5, and other squares are blocked).
     - Move 2: White plays Nc7+, checking the king on d8.
     - Black's king must move to c8 (only legal move, as d7 is blocked by Black's pawn, and e7/e8 are controlled by White's pieces).
     - Move 3: White plays Bb7+, checking the king on c8.
     - Black's king must move to b8 (only legal move, as c7 is occupied by White's knight, d8 is controlled by White's rook on f7, and other squares are blocked).
     - Move 4: White plays Ra8#, delivering checkmate, as the rook on a8 attacks b8, and Black's king has no escape squares (a7 is blocked by Black's pawn on b6, c7 is occupied by White's knight, and c8 is controlled by White's bishop on b7).
     - Let's verify the entire sequence for legality and ensure mate is on move 4, not earlier:
       - Move 1: Rxf7+ Kd8 (legal, king must move to d8).
       - Move 2: Nc7+ Kc8 (legal, king must move to c8; checkmate is not yet delivered as king escapes).
       - Move 3: Bb7+ Kb8 (legal, king must move to b8; checkmate is not yet delivered as king escapes).
       - Move 4: Ra8# (legal, rook moves to a8, king on b8 cannot escape: a7 blocked by b6 pawn, c7 occupied by knight, c8 controlled by bishop on b7. This is checkmate).
     - This sequence works perfectly for mate in exactly 4 moves.

4. **Conclusion**
   - After analyzing multiple candidate moves, the line starting with Rxf7+ leads to a forced checkmate in exactly 4 moves.
   - The sequence is: Rxf7+, Nc7+, Bb7+, Ra8#.
   - All moves are legal, checkmate is delivered on move 4, and there is no earlier checkmate in the sequence (as the Black king escapes checks on moves 1, 2, and 3).
