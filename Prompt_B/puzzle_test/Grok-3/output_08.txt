--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1
   - The lowercase 'b' in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - Since Black is to move, the objective is for Black to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 1 move.
   - From the FEN, the White king is on h1, and the Black king is on g7. Black must checkmate the White king on h1.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (Black).**
   - Let's examine Black's pieces and their potential to deliver checkmate:
     - Black has a knight on e5.
     - Black has a rook on g5.
     - Black's king is on g7, but it is unlikely to be involved in a direct checkmate in one move.
   - Possible moves to consider for checkmate:
     - Moving the rook on g5 to a position where it can attack the White king on h1.
     - Moving the knight on e5 to a position where it can attack the White king or support a checkmate.
   - Specifically:
     - Rook moves along the g-file or to the h-file (e.g., Rg5-h5 or Rg5-g1).
     - Knight moves to squares like f3, g4, g6, d3, etc., to see if any deliver checkmate.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since the task is to find a mate in 1 move, Black must deliver checkmate immediately with their move. There are no subsequent moves to consider, and White does not get a chance to respond.
   - Therefore, I will evaluate each of Black's legal moves to see if any result in checkmate right away.

   **Candidate Move 1: Rg5-h5**
   - Move the rook from g5 to h5.
   - Check if this is legal: Yes, there are no pieces blocking the path from g5 to h5.
   - Check if this delivers check: The rook on h5 attacks the h-file, but the White king is on h1, and there is a White rook on h1. In chess, a king cannot be directly attacked through another piece, but more importantly, the rook on h5 does not attack h1 directly because h1 is occupied by White's own pieces (the king and rook are on the same square in FEN notation interpretation, but in standard chess, each square holds one piece). Let me correct my visualization: the FEN shows "5RKR" on the first rank, meaning rook on f1, king on g1, rook on h1. I misread earlier.
   - Correction: Parsing the FEN correctly:
     - Rank 1: 5RKR means 5 empty squares, then Rook on f1, King on g1, Rook on h1.
     - So White king is on g1, not h1. Apologies for the earlier misread.
   - Revised: White king is on g1, White rooks on f1 and h1, White pawns on f2, g2, h2.
   - Black rook on g5 to h5: Does it attack g1? No, h5 is on the h-file, White king is on g1 (g-file). No check.
   - Conclusion: Rg5-h5 does not deliver check or checkmate.

   **Candidate Move 2: Rg5-g1**
   - Move the rook from g5 to g1.
   - Check if this is legal: The g-file from g5 to g1 is open until g1, but g1 is occupied by the White king. In chess, you cannot move a piece to a square occupied by another piece unless it's a capture, but rooks cannot capture kings (kings are not capturable; the game ends before that). However, moving a rook to the same file as the king can deliver check if the path is clear.
   - In this case, moving Rg5 to g1 is not a legal move because g1 is occupied. In standard chess notation, moving to an occupied square is invalid unless it's a capture, and since the king can't be captured, this move is not possible.
   - Correction: I need to think of it as whether the rook on g5 attacks g1. Since g1 is on the same file and there are no pieces between g5 and g1, the rook on g5 already attacks g1, but moving to g1 is not possible. However, the task is to make a move that delivers checkmate.
   - Let's try a different approach: Perhaps I misunderstood. Let's try moving the rook to a square that attacks the king.

   **Candidate Move 3: Rg5-g3**
   - Move rook from g5 to g3.
   - Is this legal? Yes, the g-file is open from g5 to g3.
   - Does this deliver check? The rook on g3 is on the same file as the White king on g1, with no pieces in between, so yes, this is check (Rg3+).
   - Is this checkmate? Checkmate requires that the king has no legal moves to escape, no piece can block the check, and the checking piece cannot be captured.
     - White king on g1, under check from rook on g3.
     - Possible king moves: f1 (but f1 is occupied by White's own rook), h1 (occupied by White's own rook), f2 (occupied by White's own pawn), g2 (occupied by White's own pawn), h2 (occupied by White's own pawn). Diagonals: f3, h3 are empty, but the king cannot move two squares away (only one square).
     - King moves to f3 or h3? King can move to f3 or h3 as they are empty.
     - Since the king can escape to f3 or h3, this is not checkmate.
   - Conclusion: Rg5-g3 delivers check but not checkmate.

   **Candidate Move 4: Ne5-f3**
   - Move knight from e5 to f3.
   - Is this legal? Yes, knight moves in an L-shape, e5 to f3 is a valid knight move (two squares down, one to the right).
   - Does this deliver check? Knight on f3 attacks g1 (one square diagonally down-right), and White king is on g1, so yes, this is check (Nf3+).
   - Is this checkmate? Check if White king can escape or if the check can be blocked or the knight captured.
     - King moves: g1 to f1 (occupied by White rook), h1 (occupied by White rook), f2 (occupied by White pawn), g2 (occupied by White pawn), h2 (occupied by White pawn), f3 (occupied by Black knight), h3 (empty), but king can only move one square.
     - Possible king moves to adjacent squares: f2, g2, h2 are blocked by own pawns; f1, h1 blocked by own rooks; f3 blocked by Black knight; g3 is empty, but king under check from knight on f3—does knight on f3 attack g3? No, knight on f3 attacks e1, g1, h2, d2, d4, e5, g5, h4. So g3 is not attacked by the knight.
     - However, I need to check other Black pieces. Black rook is on g5. If king moves to g3, it is on the g-file, and Black rook on g5 attacks g3 (since no pieces in between).
     - So king on g3 would be in check from the rook on g5.
     - Other squares: h3 is empty, knight on f3 attacks h2 but not h3, rook on g5 does not attack h3 (different file). But king on g1 to h3 is two squares, which is not a legal king move (king moves only one square).
     - Correct king moves from g1: f1 (blocked), f2 (blocked), g2 (blocked), h2 (blocked), h1 (blocked). Diagonals: f3 and h3 are not adjacent (two squares away), so invalid.
     - I think I made a mistake in king movement. King on g1 can move to f1, f2, g2, h2, h1 (all blocked), but also diagonally to f3? No: king moves one square only. g1 to f2 (blocked), g1 to h2 (blocked), etc. All adjacent squares are blocked.
     - Adjacent squares to g1: f1 (rook), f2 (pawn), g2 (pawn), h2 (pawn), h1 (rook). All occupied by White's own pieces.
     - So the White king has no legal moves to escape.
     - Can White block the check? The check is from a knight on f3 to king on g1. Since knights deliver check directly (not along a line), the check cannot be blocked by interposing a piece.
     - Can White capture the checking piece? The knight on f3—can any White piece capture it?
       - White rooks: Rook on f1—can it move to f3? f1 to f3 is blocked by White pawn on f2, so no.
       - Rook on h1—can it move to f3? h1 to f3 requires moving across files, but h1-h3 is blocked by h2 pawn, or diagonally not possible for rook.
       - White pawns: f2 can capture on e3 or g3, not f3; g2 can capture on f3 or h3, but f3 is occupied by Black knight, and pawn capture must be to an enemy piece on diagonal, but g2 to f3 is straight ahead, not diagonal capture (pawn captures diagonally only), so g2 cannot capture on f3.
       - h2 pawn can capture on g3, not f3.
       - No White piece can capture the knight on f3.
     - Therefore, king cannot move, check cannot be blocked, checking piece cannot be captured. This is checkmate.

4. **Verify explicitly:**
   - Is the move legal? Yes, Ne5 to f3 is a standard knight move, no obstructions.
   - Is checkmate delivered on the final move (move 1)? Yes, as analyzed, Nf3+ results in checkmate since White has no legal response.
   - Is there an earlier checkmate before move 1? No, since Black is to move now, and the position before Black's move does not have White in checkmate (White king is not under check currently).
   - The task specifies mate in exactly 1 move, and this achieves it.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line for Black to deliver checkmate in exactly 1 move is by moving the knight from e5 to f3, resulting in checkmate.
