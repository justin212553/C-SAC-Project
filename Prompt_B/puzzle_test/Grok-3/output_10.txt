--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1
   - The "b" in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - The objective is to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 1 move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - Black's pieces are: king on e5, pawn on e3, and pawn on f2.
   - White's piece is: king on f1.
   - Since Black is to move, I need to find a move that immediately results in checkmate.
   - Possible moves for Black:
     - Pawn on f2 can move to f1, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
     - Pawn on e3 can move to e2.
     - King on e5 can move to various squares (d4, d5, d6, e4, e6, f4, f5, f6).
   - The most promising move appears to be the pawn on f2 moving to f1 with promotion, as it directly attacks the White king’s position or controls key escape squares.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since the goal is mate in 1, Black must deliver checkmate immediately with the first move. There are no subsequent moves to consider.
   - Let’s evaluate the pawn promotion on f2 to f1:
     - If Black plays f2 to f1, promoting to a queen (f1=Q):
       - The White king is on f1, but in chess, a pawn cannot capture a piece on the promotion square during promotion. However, upon rechecking the FEN, the White king is on f1, and the Black pawn is on f2. Moving the pawn to f1 is not possible because the square is occupied by the White king, and pawns cannot move to occupied squares unless capturing diagonally. This move is illegal.
     - I need to correct my understanding: pawns promote on the 8th rank for White and 1st rank for Black, but they cannot move to a square occupied by another piece unless capturing. Since f1 is occupied by the White king, and the pawn on f2 cannot capture straight ahead, f2-f1 is not a legal move.
   - Let me double-check the FEN: 8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2
     - Black pawn on f2, White king on f1. Indeed, f2-f1 is not possible because the square is occupied, and it's not a diagonal capture.
   - I must have misread the position or the problem. Let me reconsider other moves.
   - Black pawn on e3 to e2:
     - Moving e3 to e2 does not attack the White king on f1, nor does it control any escape squares effectively. The White king can still move to e1, g1, or g2. No check is delivered.
   - Black king moves (e.g., e5 to f4, f5, etc.):
     - Moving the Black king does not directly attack the White king or restrict its movement to deliver checkmate. The White king has escape squares.
   - I need to reassess the position. Let me visualize the board again based on the FEN:
     - Rank 8: empty
     - Rank 7: empty
     - Rank 6: empty
     - Rank 5: empty
     - Rank 4: empty
     - Rank 3: Black pawn on e3, Black king on e5
     - Rank 2: Black pawn on f2
     - Rank 1: White king on f1
   - I see the issue now. I may have misunderstood the objective or the position. The Black pawn on f2 cannot move to f1 because it’s occupied. However, in chess, if a pawn reaches the last rank, it promotes, but it cannot move to an occupied square. I need to consider if I misread the FEN or if there’s a typo.
   - Let me check the FEN again: 5K2 on rank 1 means White king on f1, and 5p2 on rank 2 means Black pawn on f2. Yes, f2 to f1 is blocked.
   - I think there might be a mistake in my initial approach. Let me consider if the FEN is correct or if I’m missing something. The problem states "mate in 1 move," and Black to move, but none of the moves seem to deliver checkmate.
   - Let me try moving the Black pawn on e3 to e2. Does that create a checkmate? No, because the White king is on f1, and e2 is not attacking f1 directly, and the king has escape squares.
   - I need to think differently. Perhaps I misread the FEN or the problem. Let me check if the White king is in a position to be mated by a discovered check or something, but there are no other pieces.
   - Another thought: if the Black pawn on f2 could promote, but since f1 is occupied, it’s not possible. I think there might be an error in the problem setup or my interpretation.
   - Let me reconsider the FEN. If rank 1 is 5K2, White king on f1, but perhaps I miscounted the ranks. FEN is read from rank 8 to rank 1. Let me write it out:
     - Rank 1: 5K2 → empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, White King, empty, empty (White king on f1)
     - Rank 2: 5p2 → empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, Black pawn, empty, empty (Black pawn on f2)
     - Rank 3: 4pk2 → empty, empty, empty, empty, Black pawn, Black king, empty, empty (pawn on e3, king on e5)
   - Confirmed. Now, Black to move, mate in 1. Since f2 to f1 is illegal, and e3 to e2 doesn’t check, and king moves don’t checkmate, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem statement or FEN.
   - However, let me think if I missed a move. Black pawn on e3 to e2 doesn’t check, but let’s see the White king’s position. White king on f1, escape squares are e1, g1, g2 (since f2 is occupied by Black pawn).
   - Black pawn on f2 is on f2, so White king on f1 can move to e1 or g1 (g2 is not possible because it’s a knight’s move away, no, g2 is diagonally up, but king moves one square, so f1 to g2 is possible).
   - King on f1, possible moves: e1, e2, g1, g2, but e2 is controlled if Black pawn moves to e2, no, pawn on e3 to e2 doesn’t control e2 for check, it’s just a move.
   - I think I need to accept that none of the moves work for mate in 1. Perhaps the FEN is incorrect, or I misread the side to move.
   - FEN says "b - -", Black to move. Let me check if it’s a typo in the problem. If White were to move, White king on f1 can’t deliver mate to Black king on e5.
   - I think there is a mistake. However, let me assume the problem is correct as stated. Perhaps I missed a simple move.
   - Black pawn on e3 to e2. Now, is the White king in check? No, because pawn on e2 doesn’t attack f1. White king can move to e1, g1, or g2.
   - Unless... let me think about the Black pawn on f2. If Black pawn on f2 stays, and Black moves pawn e3 to e2, let’s see White king’s moves:
     - f1 to e1: possible
     - f1 to g1: possible
     - f1 to g2: blocked by Black pawn on f2? No, f1 to g2 is diagonal, f2 is on f2, so g2 is open.
   - I think I’m overcomplicating. Let me conclude that there is no mate in 1 with the given FEN for Black to move. Perhaps the problem intended a different position.
   - However, since the task is to find mate in 1, and I must provide an answer, I’ll assume there might be a typo in the FEN or side to move. But as per rules, I’ll stick to the given data.
   - Let me try one last time. If Black pawn on e3 moves to e2, and somehow it’s a discovered check, but there’s no piece behind it. Black king is on e5, not aligned.
   - I think the only logical conclusion is that there is no mate in 1 in this position for Black. Since the problem insists on mate in 1, I’ll state that I cannot find it, but perhaps it’s a mistake.

4. **At each step, explicitly verify that:**
   - Every move is legal: f2 to f1 is illegal as f1 is occupied.
   - Checkmate is delivered on the final move: No move delivers checkmate.
   - There is no earlier checkmate before move 1: Since it’s mate in 1, this is the first move.
   - I must conclude that there might be an error in the problem setup, as no legal move by Black results in checkmate in 1 move.

**Conclude by choosing the best forced line.**
   - Unfortunately, I cannot find a forced mate in 1 for Black in the given position. It’s possible the FEN or side to move is incorrect. However, since the task requires an answer, and I must adhere to the instructions, I’ll note that no such move exists based on my analysis. If forced to provide a move, I’ll state that there is no solution, but as per format, I’ll leave the final PGN empty or note the issue.

[FINAL PGN]
*No mate in 1 move found for Black in the given position.*
