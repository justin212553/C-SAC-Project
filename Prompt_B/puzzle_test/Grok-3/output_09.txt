--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1
   - The "w" in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - The goal is to checkmate the Black king, which is located on f8.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - White's pieces are: King on e6 and Pawn on f7.
   - Possible moves for White:
     - Pawn on f7 can move to f8, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
     - King on e6 can move to d5, d6, d7, e5, e7, f5, f6, or f7.
   - Since the objective is mate in 1 move, the move must immediately result in checkmate. Therefore, the pawn promotion on f7 to f8 is the most promising, as it introduces a new powerful piece right next to the Black king. King moves are unlikely to deliver checkmate directly, as the White king cannot attack the Black king in one move from e6 to f8.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since it's mate in 1, Black does not get a chance to respond. The move must be checkmate immediately.
   - Let's evaluate the pawn promotion:
     - Move: f7 to f8, promoting to a queen (f8=Q).
       - After f8=Q, the White queen is on f8, directly attacking the Black king on f8. However, in chess, a piece cannot occupy the same square as another piece. I need to correct my visualization.
       - Correction: The Black king is on f8, as per FEN (5k2 means king on f8). The pawn on f7 cannot move to f8 because it is occupied by the Black king. I misread the position initially.
       - Let me double-check the FEN: 5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8
         - Rank 8: 5k2 → spaces, spaces, spaces, spaces, spaces, king on f8.
         - Rank 7: 5P2 → spaces, spaces, spaces, spaces, spaces, Pawn on f7.
         - Rank 6: 4PK2 → spaces, spaces, spaces, spaces, Pawn on e6, King on f6. Correction: FEN shows 4PK2, but in standard FEN reading, it’s likely a typo or misinterpretation. Let me parse it correctly.
         - Correct FEN interpretation:
           - Rank 8: 5k2 → .....k..
           - Rank 7: 5P2 → .....P..
           - Rank 6: 4PK2 → ....PK..
           - So, Black king on f8, White pawn on f7, White king on f6 (not e6 as I initially thought).
         - Apologies for the confusion. Correct position: White king on f6, White pawn on f7, Black king on f8.
   - Now, possible moves:
     - Pawn f7 to f8, but f8 is occupied by Black king, so pawn cannot move forward (pawn cannot capture forward unless it's an en passant, which is not the case here).
     - In chess, a pawn cannot move to a square occupied by any piece, even an opponent's king. So f7-f8 is not a legal move.
     - Therefore, the only possible moves are with the White king on f6.
     - White king on f6 can move to: e5, e6, e7, f5, f7, g5, g6, g7.
   - Since it's mate in 1, the king move must result in checkmate, but a king cannot deliver checkmate by itself unless it's a special situation like opposition in a pawn endgame, but here the Black king is not in a position to be checkmated by king move alone.

4. **At each step, explicitly verify that:**
   - **Every move is legal:**
     - Pawn f7 cannot move to f8 because it's occupied by Black king. So, f7-f8 promotion is illegal.
     - King moves: Let's check if moving the king to f7 (adjacent to the pawn) does anything, but it doesn't attack the Black king directly.
     - I need to reconsider the position or FEN. Let me double-check the FEN string: 5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8
       - Rank 8: 5k2 → positions 1-5 empty, 6th is k (f8), so Black king on f8.
       - Rank 7: 5P2 → positions 1-5 empty, 6th is P (f7), so White pawn on f7.
       - Rank 6: 4PK2 → positions 1-4 empty, 5th is P (e6), 6th is K (f6), so White pawn on e6, White king on f6.
       - I misread earlier. Correct position: Black king on f8, White pawn on f7, White pawn on e6, White king on f6.
   - Corrected moves:
     - White pawn on f7 cannot move to f8 (occupied).
     - White pawn on e6 can move to e7.
     - White king on f6 can move to e5, e6 (occupied by own pawn, illegal), e7, f5, f7 (occupied by own pawn, illegal), g5, g6, g7.
   - Testing pawn move e6 to e7:
     - Move e7, no check on Black king (king on f8, pawn on e7 doesn't attack it).
   - Testing king moves:
     - King to g7: White king on g7, Black king on f8. Kings are adjacent diagonally, so it's check, but Black king can move to e8 or g8 to escape.
     - Similarly, other king moves like e7, f5, etc., do not trap the Black king.
   - I realize I may have misunderstood the goal or position. Since it's mate in 1, and no single move seems to deliver checkmate, let me reconsider the pawn on f7.
   - Pawn on f7 cannot move to f8, but I notice the FEN might be correct as is, and I need to think differently.
   - Let me visualize: Black king on f8, White pawn on f7 (directly below), White pawn on e6, White king on f6.
   - If the White pawn on f7 could promote, but it can't because f8 is occupied.
   - I suspect a possible typo in the problem or FEN. However, looking at the FEN again, perhaps it's a different interpretation or I need to consider if it's a trick.
   - Alternative thought: In some chess problems, especially mate in 1, it could involve underpromotion or a unique move, but here, no move seems to work.
   - Let me try king to g7 again: White king to g7, Black king on f8. It's check because kings can't be adjacent, but in chess, kings cannot move to adjacent squares, but here White king moving to g7 is adjacent to f8, which is illegal because you cannot move your king to a square attacked by the opponent's king.
   - Correction: In chess, you cannot move your king to a square where it would be in check. Since Black king on f8 controls g7, White king cannot move to g7. So, king to g7 is illegal.
   - Similarly, king to e7 is illegal because Black king on f8 controls e7.
   - Legal king moves are: f5, g5, g6 (since Black king controls e7 and g7).
   - None of these deliver checkmate.
   - Pawn e6 to e7: legal, but no checkmate.
   - I think there might be an error in the problem statement or FEN. However, let me check if I misread the FEN entirely.
   - FEN: 5k2/5P2/4PK2 → Rank 6 is 4PK2, which I read as pawn on e6, king on f6, but in standard FEN, it's read left to right per rank.
   - Rank 6: 4PK2 means positions 1-4 empty, 5th is P (e6), 6th is K (f6), so White pawn e6, White king f6, correct.
   - I think the problem might have a typo in FEN or intent. However, looking at the objective "mate in 1", and no move works, I suspect the FEN might be intended differently.
   - Alternative: Perhaps it's 5k2/4PP2/5K2 or something, but as per given FEN, no mate in 1 seems possible.
   - Final realization: I may have missed something. Let me think if Black king is on f8, White king on f6, pawn on f7 can't move, but pawn on e6 to e7 doesn't help.
   - I conclude there might be a mistake, but since it's a chess engine task, perhaps I need to assume the position is correct.
   - Let me try one last time: If White king moves to g6, it's not adjacent to f8 (diagonal two squares), no check.
   - No mate in 1 is possible with the given FEN. However, since the task insists on mate in 1, I suspect a typo in FEN or problem.
   - Looking at FEN pattern, perhaps it's a common mate in 1 with king and pawns. If pawn on f7 could promote, but it can't.
   - I apologize, but I must conclude no mate in 1 exists with this FEN. However, to follow instructions, I'll assume a possible intent or recheck.
   - If FEN was meant to be 5k2/4PP2/5K2 (pawns on e7 and f7, king on f6), then f7-f8=Q# would be mate, as Black king on f8 is replaced by promotion, but in standard chess, promotion can't happen on occupied square.
   - Final decision: I believe the FEN or problem has an error, but since it's a task, I'll assume it's unsolvable as is.

**Conclude by choosing the best forced line.**
- Unfortunately, I cannot find a mate in 1 with the given FEN. I suspect a typo or miscommunication in the position. As per the rules, I must provide a final PGN, but since no move achieves mate in 1, I will note this.

[FINAL PGN]

(Note: No mate in 1 is possible with the given FEN position. I suspect a typo or error in the problem setup.)
