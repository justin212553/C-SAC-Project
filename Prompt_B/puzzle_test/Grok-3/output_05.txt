--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king you must checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: 8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1
   - The 'w' in the FEN indicates that White is to move.
   - The goal is to checkmate the Black king, which is located on a6.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side.**
   - White's pieces are: King on a1, Rook on h7, Bishop on g4, and pawns on b4, c4, and c5.
   - Since the task is to find a checkmate in exactly 1 move, I need to look for a move that immediately delivers checkmate.
   - Possible moves to consider:
     - Rook moves: The rook on h7 can move along the h-file or the 7th rank. Moving to h6 or h5 could potentially attack the king on a6 if supported, but I need to check if it delivers checkmate.
     - Bishop moves: The bishop on g4 can move along the diagonals. It currently attacks squares like f5, e6, d7, and h5, but none of these directly attack the Black king on a6.
     - Pawn moves: The pawns on b4, c4, and c5 could potentially promote or capture, but there are no Black pieces to capture, and promotion would take more than one move to set up a checkmate.
     - King moves: The king on a1 is not in a position to deliver checkmate in one move.
   - The most promising piece seems to be the rook on h7, as it is mobile and can potentially coordinate with other pieces to trap the Black king.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 1 move, assuming the opponent plays reasonable defensive moves.**
   - Since it's a mate in 1, I only need to find a single move by White that results in checkmate, regardless of Black's response (since Black won't get a turn if checkmate is delivered).
   - Let's test Rook moves:
     - Rh6: Moves the rook to h6. Does this attack the Black king on a6? No, because h6 is not on the same rank, file, or diagonal as a6. The Black king is not in check, so this is not checkmate.
     - Rh5: Similarly, h5 does not attack a6 directly. No check.
     - Ra7: Moves the rook to a7, which is on the same rank as the Black king on a6. This puts the Black king in check because the rook directly attacks along the 7th rank. Now, I need to verify if the Black king has any escape squares or ways to block the check.
       - Black king on a6 can move to: a5, b5, b6, b7, a7. However:
         - a5 is attacked by the White pawn on b4 (since b4-a5 is a diagonal attack by the pawn).
         - b5 is attacked by the White pawn on c4 (c4-b5 diagonal).
         - b6 is not directly attacked by any piece (White bishop on g4 attacks d7, e6, f5, h5, etc., but not b6; pawns and rook do not attack b6).
         - b7 is not attacked.
         - a7 is occupied by the White rook after Ra7, so the king cannot move there.
       - However, since b6 and b7 are available as escape squares, the Black king can move to b6 or b7 to escape the check. Therefore, Ra7 is check but not checkmate.
     - Correction: I need to re-evaluate escape squares carefully after Ra7:
       - Black king on a6, after Ra7+, possible moves:
         - a5: Controlled by White pawn on b4 (pawn attacks diagonally).
         - b5: Controlled by White pawn on c4.
         - b6: Is b6 really safe? Let me check White's bishop on g4. The bishop's diagonal (g4-f5-e6-d7) does not reach b6. White pawns on c5, c4, b4 do not attack b6 (c5 attacks b6 diagonally, I missed this earlier).
         - c5 pawn attacks b6 (since pawn attacks one square diagonally forward), so b6 is controlled by White pawn on c5.
         - b7: Is b7 safe? White rook on a7 attacks along the 7th rank, so a7-b7-c7-d7 etc. are all attacked. Thus, b7 is controlled by the rook on a7.
         - a7: Occupied by White rook.
       - Revised: All squares around the Black king (a5, b5, b6, b7, a7) are either controlled by White pieces or occupied. Let me list them:
         - a5: Attacked by b4 pawn.
         - b5: Attacked by c4 pawn.
         - b6: Attacked by c5 pawn.
         - b7: Attacked by rook on a7.
         - a7: Occupied by rook.
       - Therefore, after Ra7+, the Black king has no legal moves to escape the check. There are no other Black pieces to interpose or capture the rook. This appears to be checkmate.
   - Testing other moves briefly to ensure there are no alternatives:
     - Bishop moves (e.g., Bh5, Bf5): None of these attack the Black king on a6, as the bishop's diagonals do not reach a6.
     - Pawn moves (e.g., c5-c6): Do not deliver check.
     - King moves: Irrelevant for checkmate in 1.

4. **At each step, explicitly verify that:**
   - **Every move is legal:** Ra7 is a legal move; the rook can move from h7 to a7 as there are no pieces in between.
   - **Checkmate is delivered on the final move:** As analyzed, Ra7 puts the Black king in check, and all possible escape squares (a5, b5, b6, b7, a7) are controlled by White pieces or occupied, so it is checkmate.
   - **There is no earlier checkmate before move 1:** Since it's mate in 1, and White is to move, there is no prior move to consider for an earlier checkmate. The position before White's move is not checkmate (Black king is not in check currently).

**Conclusion:** The best forced line is Ra7, which delivers checkmate in exactly 1 move.
