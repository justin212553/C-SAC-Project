--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN string provided is: 4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1
   - The lowercase 'b' in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - Since Black is to move, the objective is for Black to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 2 moves.
   - From the FEN, the White king is on h8 (Kh8), and the Black king is on d3 (Kd3). Black must checkmate the White king on h8.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (Black).**
   - Let's examine Black's pieces and their potential to deliver check or restrict the White king's movement.
   - Black has a queen on d3 (Qd3), a rook on f6 (Rf6), and a bishop on d4 (Bd4).
   - The White king on h8 is already somewhat confined, with Black's rook on f6 and other pieces potentially able to control escape squares.
   - Possible first moves for Black to consider (candidate moves that give check or threaten mate):
     - Qh7+: This moves the queen to h7, giving check to the White king on h8. The king has limited escape squares.
     - Qg6+: This moves the queen to g6, also giving check, potentially coordinating with the rook on f6.
     - Other queen moves like Qe2+ or Qf1+ might be considered, but they seem less direct as they don't immediately threaten the h8 square.
     - Rook moves like Rf7 or Rh6 don't give check immediately and may not lead to a forced mate in 2.
   - I will prioritize moves that give check, as they force White to respond, making it easier to calculate a forced sequence.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 2 moves, assuming reasonable defensive moves by White.**
   - **Candidate 1: Qh7+**
     - Move 1: Black plays Qd3-h7+, giving check to Kh8.
     - White's possible responses (legal moves for the king or blocking the check):
       - The White king on h8 can move to g8 (Kg8) or g7 (Kg7), as h7 is occupied by the Black queen after Qh7+.
       - White has no pieces that can block the check (no pieces can move to h7 or between d3 and h8 since Qh7 is a direct check from h7 to h8).
       - White cannot capture the queen on h7 (no pieces attack h7).
       - So, White's only legal moves are Kg8 or Kg7.
     - Response 1: If White plays Kh8-g8:
       - Black's second move: Black can play Qh7-h8#. This is checkmate because the White king on g8 is attacked by the queen on h8, and the king cannot move to f8 (blocked by Black's rook on f6), g7 (attacked by Black's queen on h8), or h8 (occupied by the queen). No other White pieces can block or capture.
     - Response 2: If White plays Kh8-g7:
       - Black's second move: Black can play Qh7-h6#. This is checkmate because the White king on g7 is attacked by the queen on h6, and the king cannot move to f8 (blocked by Black's rook on f6), g8 (attacked by Black's queen on h6), or h8 (attacked by the queen). No other White pieces can block or capture.
     - In both cases, Black delivers mate on move 2.
   - **Candidate 2: Qg6+**
     - Move 1: Black plays Qd3-g6+, giving check to Kh8.
     - White's possible responses:
       - White's king can move to g8 (Kg8) or g7 (Kg7).
       - No blocking or capturing is possible (no White pieces can move to g7 or g8 to block, and no pieces attack g6).
     - Response 1: If White plays Kh8-g8:
       - Black's second move: Black can play Qg6-h6, but this is not checkmate (White king on g8 can move to f7 or h7). Alternatively, Qg6-g7 is not checkmate either (king can move to h7). There is no immediate mate here.
     - Response 2: If White plays Kh8-g7:
       - Black's second move: Black can play Qg6-h6+, but this is not mate (king can move to f7 or h7). No mate in 2 is apparent.
     - This line does not lead to a forced mate in 2.
   - Other moves like Qe2+ or Qf1+ lead to the king escaping to g7 or g8 without an immediate mate threat on the next move, so they are less promising and won't be calculated further.

4. **Verify legality, checkmate on the final move, and no earlier mate.**
   - For the line with Qh7+:
     - Move 1: Qh7+ is legal (queen moves from d3 to h7, no pieces in between, and it's Black's turn).
     - After Qh7+, White must respond with Kg8 or Kg7 (both legal moves).
     - Move 2: If Kg8, then Qh8# is legal (queen moves to h8, no obstruction) and is checkmate (as explained).
     - If Kg7, then Qh6# is legal (queen moves to h6) and is checkmate (as explained).
     - There is no mate on move 1 since Qh7+ is only check, not checkmate (White king has escape squares).
     - Thus, this is a mate in exactly 2 moves.
   - No other candidate move (like Qg6+) provides a forced mate in 2.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line for Black to deliver checkmate in exactly 2 moves is to start with Qh7+, followed by Qh8# if White plays Kg8, or Qh6# if White plays Kg7. This satisfies all conditions: legal moves, mate on move 2, and no earlier mate.
