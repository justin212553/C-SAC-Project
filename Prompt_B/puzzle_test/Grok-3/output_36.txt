--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN string provided is: `6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1`.
   - The lowercase 'b' in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - Since Black is to move, the objective is for Black to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 4 moves.
   - The White king is on h4, and the Black king is on g8. Our target is to checkmate the White king on h4 or wherever it may move.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (Black).**
   - Black's pieces are: king on g8, queen on b2, rook on g2.
   - White's pieces are: king on h4, queen on e3, rook on c7, pawns on a3, f4, g4, h3.
   - Black's rook on g2 and queen on b2 are well-positioned to attack the White king on h4, which is somewhat exposed.
   - Possible first moves for Black to initiate an attack:
     - **Rg3**: This move attacks the h3 pawn and threatens to coordinate with the queen for a potential check or mate.
     - **Qb1+**: This delivers a check immediately, forcing the White king to move.
     - **Qe5+**: Another check, attacking the king directly and potentially coordinating with the rook.
   - I will prioritize moves that deliver check or create immediate threats, as the goal is a forced mate in 4 moves.

3. **Calculate concrete lines for exactly 4 moves for each candidate, assuming reasonable defensive moves by White.**
   - I will analyze each candidate move step by step to see if it leads to a forced checkmate in exactly 4 moves (i.e., Black's 4th move delivers mate).

   **Candidate 1: 1... Qb1+**
   - Move 1: 1... Qb1+ (Black checks the White king on h4).
     - Legal move: Yes, the queen moves from b2 to b1, checking the king on h4.
     - White's response: The king must move. Possible moves are h5, g3, or h3.
     - Let's try 2. Kh5 (most logical to move away from the g-file where the rook is).
   - Move 2: Black needs to continue the attack. Possible move: 2... Qh1 (threatening mate on h5).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White's response: 3. Kg6 (only move to avoid immediate mate).
   - Move 3: Black plays 3... Qxh3 (taking the pawn and threatening mate on g2 or h5).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White's response: 4. Kf7 (trying to escape).
   - Move 4: Black plays 4... Qh5# (delivering mate as the king has no escape squares).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - Is it mate? Yes, White king on f7 is checked by queen on h5, no escape squares (f8 blocked by Black king, e8 and g8 out of reach, g6 attacked by queen).
     - Is mate delivered on move 4? Yes.
     - Is there an earlier mate? Let's check:
       - After 1... Qb1+, no mate.
       - After 2... Qh1, no mate yet (king can move).
       - After 3... Qxh3, no mate yet (king can move to f7).
       - Mate only on move 4.
   - Now, check if White has other defenses:
     - After 1... Qb1+, if 2. Kg3, then 2... Qe1+ 3. Kh2 Qf2+ 4. Kh1 Qg1# (mate on move 4).
     - If 2. Kh3, then 2... Qh1+ 3. Kg3 Qe1+ 4. Kh2 Qf2# (mate on move 4).
   - This line seems to work for all White king moves after the first check.

   **Candidate 2: 1... Rg3**
   - Move 1: 1... Rg3 (attacking h3 pawn and threatening mate on h3 if pawn moves).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White's response: 2. hxg3 (capturing the rook to avoid immediate threats).
   - Move 2: 2... Qb1+ (delivering check).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White: 3. Kh5 (forced move).
   - Move 3: 3... Qh1 (threatening mate).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White: 4. Kg6 (only move).
   - Move 4: 4... Qxh6# (mate? No, h6 is not attacking the king on g6 directly for mate; this is incorrect).
     - Correction: After 3... Qh1, White king on h5, 4... Qxh6+ is check, but king can move to g4 or elsewhere. No mate.
   - This line fails to deliver mate in 4. Let's abandon this for now as Qb1+ already works.

   **Candidate 3: 1... Qe5+**
   - Move 1: 1... Qe5+ (checking the king).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White: 2. Kh5 (or other moves).
   - Move 2: 2... Qh2 (threatening mate on h5).
     - Legal: Yes.
     - White: 3. Kg6 Qxh3 (as before).
   - This seems similar to the Qb1+ line but might not be as forcing. Since Qb1+ already works, I’ll stick with that.

4. **Verify the chosen line (1... Qb1+).**
   - Line: 1... Qb1+ 2. Kh5 Qh1 3. Kg6 Qxh3 4. Kf7 Qh5#
     - Move 1: Legal, check.
     - Move 2: Legal, threat of mate.
     - Move 3: Legal, capturing pawn, still threatening.
     - Move 4: Legal, delivers mate (king on f7, queen on h5, no escape).
     - No earlier mate: Checked above.
   - Alternative White moves:
     - 2. Kg3 Qe1+ 3. Kh2 Qf2+ 4. Kh1 Qg1# (mate on move 4).
     - 2. Kh3 Qh1+ 3. Kg3 Qe1+ 4. Kh2 Qf2# (mate on move 4).
   - All lines lead to mate on Black's 4th move, no faster, no slower.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line for Black to deliver checkmate in exactly 4 moves starts with 1... Qb1+. This move initiates a series of checks and threats that force White's king into a position where it is mated on the 4th move, regardless of White's responses.
