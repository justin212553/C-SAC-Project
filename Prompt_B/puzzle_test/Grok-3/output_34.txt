--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Identify which side is to move and the king to checkmate.**
   - The FEN notation provided is: r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1
   - The 'b' in the FEN indicates that Black is to move.
   - Therefore, Black is the attacking side, and the goal is to deliver checkmate to the White king in exactly 4 moves.
   - The White king is currently on e1.

2. **List the most promising candidate moves for the attacking side (Black).**
   - Black's pieces include a rook on a8, a knight on d4, a rook on c2, bishops on g4 and h4, and a king on h8, with pawns on c6, e5, g6, and h6.
   - White's pieces include a king on e1, a knight on e8, rooks on a7, f7, and f2, a bishop on b1, and pawns on b3 and d3.
   - Black needs to deliver checkmate in 4 moves, so I will look for moves that immediately threaten check or restrict the White king's movement.
   - Promising moves for Black could involve the rook on c2, knight on d4, or bishops on g4 and h4 to attack near the White king.
   - Candidate moves to consider:
     - ...Rxf2: Capturing the rook on f2 with the rook on c2, attacking the White king directly and potentially opening lines.
     - ...Nxf2: Capturing the rook on f2 with the knight on d4, also attacking near the king.
     - ...Bxf2+: Checking the White king directly with the bishop on g4.
   - I will prioritize moves that give check or force a response, as they are more likely to lead to a forced sequence.

3. **For each candidate, calculate a concrete line for exactly 4 moves, assuming reasonable defensive moves by White.**
   - **Candidate 1: ...Bxf2+**
     - Move 1: ...Bxf2+ (Black bishop on g4 captures the rook on f2, giving check to the White king on e1).
     - White's only legal responses are to move the king (to d1 or f1, since e2 is blocked by the pawn on d3 and other squares are attacked or occupied).
     - Let's try Kd1:
       - Move 2: If White plays Kd1, Black can play ...Be3+ (bishop moves to e3, giving check again).
       - White must move the king again, say to c1 (other moves like Ke1 lead to similar attacks).
       - Move 3: Black plays ...Bc1+ (bishop moves to c1, giving check).
       - White must move to b2 (only legal move).
       - Move 4: Black can play ...Rb8# (rook on a8 to b8, checkmate, as the king on b2 has no escape squares—b1 is occupied by White's bishop, a1 and c1 are attacked by Black's bishop, and b3 is occupied by White's pawn).
     - This line seems promising: 1...Bxf2+ 2. Kd1 Be3+ 3. Kc1 Bc1+ 4. Kb2 Rb8#
     - I need to check if White has other responses after 1...Bxf2+.
     - If White plays Kf1 instead of Kd1:
       - Move 2: Black can play ...Be3+ (bishop to e3, check).
       - White must move to g1 (only legal move, as f2 is occupied by Black's bishop, e1 is attacked, and h1 is out of bounds).
       - Move 3: Black plays ...Bh3+ (bishop to h3, check).
       - White must move to h1 (only legal move).
       - Move 4: Black plays ...Bg2# (bishop to g2, checkmate, as the king on h1 has no escape squares—g1 is attacked by the bishop on e3, h2 is out of bounds).
     - So, another line: 1...Bxf2+ 2. Kf1 Be3+ 3. Kg1 Bh3+ 4. Kh1 Bg2#
     - Both lines deliver checkmate in exactly 4 moves.

   - **Candidate 2: ...Rxf2**
     - Move 1: ...Rxf2 (Black rook on c2 captures the rook on f2, no check but threatens the king indirectly).
     - White can respond in multiple ways, such as moving the king to d1 or f1, or using other pieces to attack.
     - If White plays Kd1:
       - Move 2: Black can play ...Rd2+ (rook to d2, check).
       - White moves to c1.
       - Move 3: Black plays ...Rc2+ (rook to c2, check).
       - White moves to b1.
       - Move 4: Black has no immediate checkmate (e.g., ...Rb2+ is check but not mate, as White can move to a1).
     - This line does not lead to checkmate in 4 moves.
     - Other responses by White (like Rf3 attacking the rook) also complicate the position without a clear forced mate.
     - This candidate is less promising than ...Bxf2+.

   - **Candidate 3: ...Nxf2**
     - Move 1: ...Nxf2 (Black knight on d4 captures the rook on f2, no check).
     - White can move the king or counterattack.
     - If White plays Kd1:
       - Move 2: Black can play ...Ne4 or other moves, but there is no immediate check or forced sequence leading to mate in 4.
     - This does not seem to force a quick checkmate compared to ...Bxf2+.

4. **Verify the chosen line for legality, checkmate on move 4, and no earlier mate.**
   - Chosen line: 1...Bxf2+ 2. Kd1 Be3+ 3. Kc1 Bc1+ 4. Kb2 Rb8#
     - Move 1: ...Bxf2+ is legal (bishop on g4 to f2, capturing rook, king on e1 is in check).
     - Move 2: Kd1 is legal (king moves to d1); Black's ...Be3+ is legal (bishop to e3, check).
     - Move 3: Kc1 is legal (king to c1); Black's ...Bc1+ is legal (bishop to c1, check).
     - Move 4: Kb2 is legal (king to b2); Black's ...Rb8# is legal (rook on a8 to b8, and it is checkmate as b1 is occupied, a1 and c1 are attacked by the bishop on c1, b3 is occupied).
     - Is there an earlier mate? After 1...Bxf2+, no immediate mate exists. After 2...Be3+, no mate yet (king can move). After 3...Bc1+, no mate yet (king can move to b2). Mate only occurs on move 4.
   - Alternative line: 1...Bxf2+ 2. Kf1 Be3+ 3. Kg1 Bh3+ 4. Kh1 Bg2#
     - All moves are legal, and checkmate is delivered only on move 4, with no earlier mate possible.
   - Both lines satisfy the condition of mate in exactly 4 moves, with no faster mate available.

**Conclusion:**
The best forced line is starting with 1...Bxf2+, leading to checkmate in exactly 4 moves regardless of White's king movement to d1 or f1. I will present one of the lines in the final output.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Bxf2+ 2. Kd1 Be3+ 3. Kc1 Bc1+ 4. Kb2 Rb8#
