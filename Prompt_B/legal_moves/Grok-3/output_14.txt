--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN string: 4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1. The FEN notation indicates that it is Black's turn to move, as denoted by the "b" in the second field.

Next, I will identify the positions of all pieces on the board based on the FEN string:
- Black pieces: King on c2, Rooks on e8 and f7, pawns on c3, d6, and f6.
- White pieces: King on a3, pawns on a2 and b5.

Now, I will consider the possible moves for Black. Black has several pieces that can move: the King, two Rooks, and three pawns. I will evaluate a few candidate moves for each piece to ensure they are legal, meaning they follow the piece's movement rules, do not leave the Black King in check, and do not move to a square occupied by another Black piece.

1. **Black King moves**: The King on c2 can potentially move to b1, b2, b3, c1, c3, d1, d2, or d3. However, c3 is occupied by a Black pawn, so that square is not available. I will check a couple of these moves:
   - Moving the King to b1: This is a legal move as b1 is empty, and moving there does not appear to put the King in immediate danger from White's pieces (White's King is on a3 and pawns on a2 and b5 cannot attack b1 directly).
   - Moving the King to d2: This is also a legal move as d2 is empty, and it does not seem to expose the King to check.

2. **Black Rook moves**: There are two Rooks, one on e8 and one on f7.
   - Rook on e8 can move along the e-file or the 8th rank. Possible moves include e7, e6, e5, etc., or d8, c8, etc. For instance, moving to e7 is legal as the square is empty.
   - Rook on f7 can move along the f-file or the 7th rank. Possible moves include f8, f6 (but f6 is occupied by a Black pawn, so not possible), or g7, h7, etc. Moving to g7 is legal as the square is empty.

3. **Black Pawn moves**: There are pawns on c3, d6, and f6.
   - Pawn on c3 can move to c2, but c2 is occupied by the Black King, so this move is not possible. It cannot capture anything as there are no White pieces on b2 or d2.
   - Pawn on d6 can move to d5, which is empty, making this a legal move.
   - Pawn on f6 can move to f5, which is empty, making this a legal move as well.

I have identified several legal moves for Black, including King to b1 or d2, Rook on e8 to e7, Rook on f7 to g7, pawn on d6 to d5, and pawn on f6 to f5. Now, I need to choose one of these moves. Since the instruction is to pick a single legal move without necessarily optimizing for the best strategy (as no specific goal like checkmate is mentioned), I will select a simple and safe move.

I will choose to move the Black King from c2 to d2. This move is legal as d2 is empty, it follows the King's movement rules (one square in any direction), and it does not leave the King in check since White's pieces cannot attack d2 directly (White King is too far, and pawns do not threaten d2).

Therefore, my chosen move for Black is King from c2 to d2.
