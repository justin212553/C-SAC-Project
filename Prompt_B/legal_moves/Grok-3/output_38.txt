--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to determine which side is to move in the given position. The FEN string provided is "4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R b - - 0 1". In FEN notation, the second field indicates the side to move, and here it is "b", which means Black is to move.

Next, I will identify Black's pieces and their possible moves. Looking at the board setup from the FEN:
- Black has a king on g8.
- A rook on e8.
- A bishop on c5.
- A bishop on a6.
- Knights on e4 and g4.
- Pawns on a7, f7, g7, and h7.

Now, I will consider the possible moves for each of Black's pieces:
1. **King on g8**: The king can potentially move to f8 or h8, as those squares appear to be unoccupied by Black's pieces. I need to ensure that moving the king does not place it in check, but I’ll evaluate this after considering other pieces.
2. **Rook on e8**: The rook can move along the e-file or the 8th rank. Possible moves include e7, e6, e5, etc., down the file, or to d8, c8, b8, a8 along the rank, provided the squares are not occupied by Black's pieces and the move is legal.
3. **Bishop on c5**: This bishop can move along the diagonals. Possible squares include b4, a3, d6, e7, etc., as long as the path is clear and the destination is not occupied by a Black piece.
4. **Bishop on a6**: This bishop can move along its diagonals to b5, c4, d3, e2, f1, or b7, c8, provided the squares are empty or occupied by a White piece.
5. **Knight on e4**: Knights move in an L-shape. Possible moves include d6, f6, g5, g3, f2, d2, c3, c5. I need to check if these squares are occupied by Black pieces.
6. **Knight on g4**: Possible moves include e5, e3, f2, h2, h6, f6, h5. Again, I’ll check for occupancy.
7. **Pawns**: The pawns on a7, f7, g7, and h7 can move forward one or two squares if it’s their first move and the path is clear, or capture diagonally if a White piece is present.

Now, I will pick a few candidate moves and verify their legality:
- **Rook from e8 to e7 (Re7)**: Checking the board, e7 is not occupied by any piece (FEN shows e7 as empty). Moving the rook to e7 does not seem to expose the king to check immediately, as the rook is not a key defender in this position. This appears to be a legal move.
- **Knight from e4 to d6 (Ned6)**: The square d6 is empty (FEN confirms). A knight move does not affect the king’s safety directly since it’s not a sliding piece. This move seems legal.
- **Bishop from c5 to d6 (Bd6)**: The square d6 is empty, and the bishop can move there along the diagonal. This move also appears legal as it does not expose the king to check.

I have now identified at least three legal moves: Re7, Ned6, and Bd6. I will choose one of these moves. Since the goal is to select a single legal move without needing to optimize for the best strategy (as per the instructions), I will pick the rook move to e7, as it is a simple developing move that maintains control over the e-file.

To confirm, I’ll ensure the move follows the piece’s movement rules: A rook moves vertically or horizontally, and e8 to e7 is a vertical move of one square. The square e7 is not occupied by a Black piece, and moving the rook does not leave the king in check (there are no immediate threats to g8 that the rook is blocking). Thus, Re7 is a legal move.

I will output this move in the required format.
