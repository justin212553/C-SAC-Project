--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position in FEN format: 5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1. The FEN string indicates that it is White's turn to move, as denoted by the "w" in the second field. My task is to choose a single legal move for White.

Let's visualize the board based on the FEN notation:
- 8th rank: 5 empty squares, then rook (r), king (k), rook (r) – Black's pieces.
- 7th rank: 5 empty squares, then 3 pawns (p) – Black's pawns.
- 6th to 5th ranks: All empty.
- 4th rank: 4 empty squares, then knight (N), 1 empty square, rook (R) – White's pieces.
- 3rd to 2nd ranks: All empty.
- 1st rank: 6 empty squares, then king (K), 1 empty square – White's king.

Breaking it down to specific squares:
- Black pieces: Rook on f8, King on g8, Rook on h8, Pawns on f7, g7, h7.
- White pieces: Knight on e4, Rook on g4, King on g2.

Now, I confirm it's White to move. I need to identify all of White's pieces that can move and consider a few candidate moves.

White's pieces are:
- King on g2
- Knight on e4
- Rook on g4

Let's consider possible moves for each piece:

1. **King on g2**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are f1, f2, f3, g1, g3, h1, h2, h3. None of these squares are occupied by White's own pieces, and I need to ensure the king isn't moving into check. A quick glance shows Black's rooks are on f8 and h8, pawns on f7, g7, h7, and king on g8. Moving to g3 or h3 might be closer to Black's pieces, but Black's king is on g8 and can't attack immediately, and the rooks and pawns are far away. So, moves like Kg3 or Kh3 seem safe for now.

2. **Knight on e4**: The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one perpendicular, or vice versa. From e4, possible moves are to c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, g5. None of these squares are occupied by White's pieces, so all are potential moves. I need to ensure the knight isn't moving to a square attacked by Black, but for simplicity, I'll assume these are legal for now unless an obvious threat exists. Black's pawns on f7, g7, h7 don't immediately attack these squares, and the rooks are on the 8th rank, so moves like Nf6 or Ng5 might even attack Black's pawns.

3. **Rook on g4**: The rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. From g4, it can move along the g-file to g1, g2 (but g2 is occupied by White's king, so not possible), g3, g5, g6, g7 (but g7 has Black's pawn, so it can capture), g8 (but g8 has Black's king, so it can capture). Horizontally, on the 4th rank, it can move to a4, b4, c4, d4, e4 (but e4 is occupied by White's knight, so not possible), f4, h4. So possible moves include Rg5, Rg6, Rxg7, Rxg8, Ra4, etc. Capturing on g7 or g8 might be interesting, but I need to check if it leaves White's king in check or if it's safe.

Now, I mentally check a few candidate moves for legality:
- **Kg3**: King moves to g3. It doesn't leave the king in check since Black's pieces are far away, and no Black piece directly attacks g3 (Black's king is on g8, rooks on f8 and h8 don't control g3, pawns on f7, g7, h7 don't attack g3). This is a legal move.
- **Nf6**: Knight moves to f6, attacking the pawn on g7 and potentially threatening the rook on f8. Black's pieces don't seem to attack f6 directly (pawns on f7 and h7 don't control f6, rooks are on 8th rank, king on g8). This seems legal.
- **Rxg7**: Rook captures the pawn on g7. After this move, I need to ensure White's king isn't in check. Black's rook on f8 now has an open file to f2, but White's king is on g2, so not directly attacked. Black's other rook on h8 and king on g8 don't attack White's king on g2. This move seems legal and also captures a pawn.

I have a few legal moves to choose from: Kg3 (safe but passive), Nf6 (active, attacking a pawn), Rxg7 (captures a pawn, potentially aggressive). Since the goal is to pick one legal move, and capturing material is often a good choice unless it leads to a worse position, I'll go with Rxg7. It gains a pawn and doesn't seem to immediately put White in danger.

To double-check: After Rxg7, Black's responses could include moving the rook from f8 to f2 to attack near the king, but White's king can move away, and it's not in immediate check. So, it remains a legal move.

Therefore, I will choose Rxg7 as my move.
