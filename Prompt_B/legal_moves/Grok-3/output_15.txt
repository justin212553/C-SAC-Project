--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN string: r3r3/p7/1p1n1B2/7R/4k3/PP1p1RP1/7P/3K4 w - - 0 1. The FEN notation indicates that it is White's turn to move, as denoted by the "w" in the second field.

Next, I will identify the positions of White's pieces and consider possible moves. From the FEN string, White has the following pieces:
- King on d1
- Rook on h5
- Rook on f3
- Bishop on f6
- Pawns on a3, b3, f2, and h2

Now, I will briefly consider the possible moves for each of White's pieces:
1. **King on d1**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are c1, c2, d2, e2, and e1, as long as they are not occupied by White's own pieces or under attack. I need to ensure the king does not move into check.
2. **Rook on h5**: The rook can move horizontally or vertically. It can move along the h-file (h1 to h8, except h5) or along the 5th rank (a5 to g5), provided the squares are not occupied by White's pieces.
3. **Rook on f3**: Similarly, this rook can move along the f-file (f1 to f8, except f3) or along the 3rd rank (a3 to h3, except f3), avoiding squares occupied by White's pieces.
4. **Bishop on f6**: The bishop can move diagonally. Possible diagonals are from f6 to a1 or h8, as long as the path is clear and the destination is not occupied by a White piece.
5. **Pawns**: Each pawn can move forward one or two squares if on its starting rank, or one square otherwise, and can capture diagonally. I need to check each pawn's position:
   - Pawn on a3: Can move to a4.
   - Pawn on b3: Can move to b4.
   - Pawn on f2: Can move to f3 (but f3 is occupied by White's rook, so this is not possible) or f4.
   - Pawn on h2: Can move to h3 or h4.

I will now select a few candidate moves and verify their legality:
- **King to d2 (Kd2)**: Check if d2 is under attack by Black pieces. Black has a king on e4, a knight on d6, rooks on a8 and e8, and pawns on a7, b6, and d3. The Black king on e4 attacks d3, e3, f3, etc., but not d2. The knight on d6 attacks b5, b7, c4, c8, e4, e8, f5, f7; d2 is not attacked. Black rooks and pawns do not attack d2. Also, d2 is not occupied by a White piece. So, Kd2 appears legal.
- **Rook on h5 to h6 (Rh6)**: The rook moves vertically to h6. The square h6 is empty, and moving the rook does not expose the White king to check since the king is on d1, far from this action. This move seems legal.
- **Bishop on f6 to g7 (Bg7)**: The bishop moves diagonally to g7, which is empty. The path is clear, and this move does not expose the White king to check. This move is legal.

I have identified at least three legal moves: Kd2, Rh6, and Bg7. I need to choose one. Since the goal is to select a single legal move without necessarily optimizing for the best strategy (as the instruction does not require the best move, just a legal one), I will pick Rh6. It is a simple move that advances the rook and appears safe.

To double-check, I confirm that h6 is empty (it is, from the FEN), and moving the rook from h5 to h6 does not put the White king in check, as Black's pieces do not gain any new attacks on d1 due to this move. Black's knight on d6, rooks, and pawns are not positioned to attack d1, and the Black king is on e4, too far to attack d1 immediately.

Thus, Rh6 is a legal move for White.
