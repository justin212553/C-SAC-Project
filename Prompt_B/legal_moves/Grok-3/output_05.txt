--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN string: 8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1. The FEN notation tells me the arrangement of pieces on the board, which side is to move, and other game state information. Let's break it down:

- The board layout from rank 8 to rank 1 is:
  - Rank 8: empty
  - Rank 7: white rook on h7
  - Rank 6: black king on a6
  - Rank 5: white pawn on c5
  - Rank 4: white pawn on b4, white pawn on c4, white bishop on g4
  - Rank 3: empty
  - Rank 2: empty
  - Rank 1: white king on a1
- The 'w' in the FEN indicates that it is White's turn to move.
- There are no castling rights ('-'), no en passant target ('-'), and the move number is 1, though this is less relevant for choosing a single move.

Now, I know White is to move, and I can see White's pieces are: king on a1, rook on h7, bishop on g4, and pawns on b4, c4, and c5. I need to consider the possible moves for each of these pieces.

Let's list out the pieces and think about their potential moves:

1. **King on a1**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are a2, b1, and b2 (since it's on the edge of the board). I need to ensure the king doesn't move into check, but since the only black piece is the king on a6, which is far away, none of these squares are under attack. So, possible moves are Ka2, Kb1, Kb2.

2. **Rook on h7**: The rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. On h7, it can move along the h-file to h8, h6, h5, h4, h3, h2, or h1, or along the 7th rank to g7, f7, e7, d7, c7, b7, or a7. None of these squares are occupied by White's own pieces, so all are potential moves. I also note that moving to a7 would attack the black king on a6, as rooks attack diagonally adjacent squares only if considering check, but here it's a direct line. However, a7 is on the same rank, so Ra7 would indeed put the black king in check since the rook would be on a7 and the king on a6, one square away on the same rank. So, moves like Rh8, Rh6, Ra7, etc., are possible.

3. **Bishop on g4**: The bishop moves diagonally. From g4, it can move to h5, f5, e6, d7, h3, f3, e2, or d1, as long as the path is clear and it doesn't land on a square with a White piece. Checking the board, none of these squares have White pieces, and the paths are clear. Notably, moving to d7 would attack the black king on a6 (since d7 to a6 is a diagonal move, three squares away, but bishops attack along diagonals). So, Bd7 is a checking move. Other moves like Bh5, Bf5, etc., are also legal.

4. **Pawn on b4**: Pawns move forward one square (or two from the starting position, but b4 is not the starting rank for White pawns). So, it can move to b5 if unoccupied, which it is. It cannot capture anything since there are no black pieces on a5 or c5 (diagonal squares for capture). So, b5 is the only move for this pawn.

5. **Pawn on c4**: Similarly, it can move to c5, but c5 is already occupied by a White pawn, so this pawn cannot move forward. There are no black pieces on b5 or d5 to capture, so no moves are possible for this pawn.

6. **Pawn on c5**: It can move to c6 if unoccupied, which it is. No black pieces on b6 or d6 to capture, so only c6 is possible.

Now, I have several candidate moves for White: Ka2, Kb1, Kb2 (king moves); Rh8, Rh6, Ra7, etc. (rook moves); Bh5, Bf5, Bd7, etc. (bishop moves); b5 (b4 pawn); c6 (c5 pawn).

Next, I need to ensure these moves are legal, meaning they follow the piece's movement rules (which I've checked), don't land on a square occupied by a White piece (none do), and don't leave the White king in check. Since the only black piece is the king on a6, and it's not in a position to attack the White king on a1 no matter where the White king moves (within its possible squares), or regardless of other piece moves, there’s no way for the White king to be in check after any move. The black king can't attack immediately after White's move since it's Black's turn next, and check is only evaluated after the opponent's move. So, all moves are legal in terms of not leaving the king in check.

I will pick a few candidate moves to consider more deeply:

- **Ra7**: This moves the rook to a7, directly on the same rank as the black king on a6, one square away. Since rooks control the entire rank, this puts the black king in check. This seems like a strong move as it attacks the opponent’s king directly.
- **Bd7**: This moves the bishop to d7, which is on a diagonal with a6 (d7 to c6 to b5 to a6 is not relevant; actually, d7 to a6 is a direct diagonal: d7-c6-b5-a6, yes, it's the same diagonal). So, Bd7 also puts the black king in check. Another strong move.
- **c6**: Moving the pawn on c5 to c6 advances a pawn towards promotion, which is generally a good strategy, especially since it's closer to the 8th rank.
- **Ka2**: Moving the king towards the center or action, but it doesn't seem immediately impactful compared to checking moves.

Among these, Ra7 and Bd7 both give check, which is usually a forcing move and can be advantageous as it limits Black's responses. Between Ra7 and Bd7, I note that Ra7 places the rook on a7, and the black king on a6 can only move to b5, b6, or b7 (since a5, a7, a8 are controlled by the rook on a7 or out of bounds). Let's think: rook on a7 controls the entire a-file and 7th rank, so black king on a6, if it moves to a5, is still on the a-file (controlled by rook), a7 is occupied by rook, a8 is on a-file, so can't go there. On rank 6, b6 is possible, but actually, rook on a7 controls 7th rank, not 6th rank, so black king can move to b6, b5, etc. I miscalculated; rook on a7 controls a-file (a1 to a8) and 7th rank (a7 to h7), so black king on a6 can move to b5, b6, or a5 is on a-file, so no: a5 is a-file, controlled by rook, a7 is occupied, so black king can only move to b5 or b6. I think b5 is controlled by White pawn on c4 potentially, but pawns attack diagonally, so c4 pawn attacks b5 and d5, yes, so b5 is attacked by pawn on c4. So black king on a6, if White plays Ra7, black king can only move to b6, as b5 is controlled by pawn on c4, a5 by rook, a7 occupied, etc. This seems very restrictive.

Similarly, Bd7 check, bishop on d7 attacks a6, so black king must move off the diagonal d7-a6, so can't go to b5 (still on diagonal), or c4 (occupied by White pawn), so can only go to b6 or a5. This also restricts.

Both moves are strong, but I think Ra7 is interesting as it coordinates with the pawn on c4 controlling b5. I will choose Ra7 as it seems to put immediate pressure.

I double-check if Ra7 is legal: rook from h7 to a7, along the 7th rank, no pieces in between, lands on empty square, doesn't expose White king to check (impossible here), so yes, it's legal.

Therefore, I will select Ra7 as my move.
