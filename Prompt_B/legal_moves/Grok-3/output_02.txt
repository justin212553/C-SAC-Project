--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position in FEN format: 5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1. The FEN notation tells me the arrangement of pieces on the board, which side is to move, and other game state information. Let's break it down:

- The board position is described as:
  - 8th rank: 5 empty squares, black king (k), 1 empty square, white king (K)
  - 7th rank: 5 empty squares, black queen (q), black knight (n), 1 empty square
  - 6th rank: 6 empty squares, black bishop (b), 1 empty square
  - 5th to 1st ranks: all empty squares
- The side to move is indicated by "b", meaning Black moves next.
- The castling rights are "-", meaning no castling is possible for either side.
- There is no en passant target square.
- The move number and halfmove clock are not directly relevant for choosing a move.

So, the position is: Black king on f8, White king on h8, Black queen on f7, Black knight on g7, Black bishop on g6. Black is to move.

Next, I need to consider which of Black’s pieces can move. Black has four pieces: the king on f8, the queen on f7, the knight on g7, and the bishop on g6. I will briefly evaluate possible moves for each piece, ensuring they are legal by following the piece’s movement rules, not leaving the Black king in check (though with no White pieces attacking, this is less of a concern), and not moving to a square occupied by another Black piece.

1. **Black King on f8**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to e8, e7, f7, g7, g8. However, f7 is occupied by the Black queen, and g7 is occupied by the Black knight. So, the legal moves for the king are e8, e7, and g8.

2. **Black Queen on f7**: The queen can move any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). From f7, it can move along the f-file to f1 through f6 or f8, along the 7th rank to a7 through e7 or g7 through h7, and diagonally in all directions (e.g., to e8, d5, h5, etc.). However, g7 is occupied by the Black knight, so it cannot move there or beyond on that line. Similarly, f8 is occupied by the Black king. So, legal moves include f6, f5, f4, f3, f2, f1, e7, d7, c7, b7, a7, h7, e8, g8, h5, e6, d5, etc., as long as the destination square is empty or occupied by an opponent’s piece (in this case, only the White king on h8 could be captured).

3. **Black Knight on g7**: The knight moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one perpendicular, or vice versa). From g7, possible moves are to e8, e6, f5, h5. All these squares are empty, so all are legal moves.

4. **Black Bishop on g6**: The bishop moves diagonally any number of squares. From g6, it can move to h7, h5, f7, f5, e4, d3, c2, b1. However, f7 is occupied by the Black queen, so it cannot move there or beyond on that diagonal. Legal moves include h7, h5, f5, e4, d3, c2, b1.

Now, I need to pick one legal move. Since the goal is simply to choose a single legal move without a specific strategic aim provided, I will select a move that is straightforward and safe. Looking at the position, Black has a significant material advantage (queen, knight, and bishop against a lone White king), so almost any move will maintain a winning position. I’ll consider a move with the queen, as it’s a powerful piece. One simple move is to move the queen from f7 to f6, which is a legal move since f6 is empty, it doesn’t put the Black king in check (White has no pieces to attack), and it’s within the queen’s movement range.

To double-check, let’s ensure there are no overlooked restrictions. The White king on h8 is not directly threatened by this move, but that’s fine since the task is just to pick a legal move, not necessarily to checkmate immediately. There are no other pieces blocking or other rules violated by moving the queen to f6.

Therefore, I will choose the move Queen from f7 to f6 as my selected legal move for Black.
