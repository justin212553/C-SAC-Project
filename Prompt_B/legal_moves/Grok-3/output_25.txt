--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

First, I need to analyze the given chess position in FEN format: 2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1. The FEN string indicates that it is White's turn to move, as denoted by the "w" in the second field. My task is to select a single legal move for White.

Let's visualize the board based on the FEN notation:
- 8th rank: 2R5 (two empty squares, a White rook on c8, five empty squares)
- 7th rank: kp3r1q (Black king on a7, Black pawn on b7, three empty squares, Black rook on f7, one empty square, Black queen on h7)
- 6th rank: p4Q2 (Black pawn on a6, four empty squares, White queen on f6, two empty squares)
- 5th rank: P3P1B1 (White pawn on a5, three empty squares, White pawn on e5, one empty square, White bishop on g5, one empty square)
- 4th rank: K7 (White king on a4, seven empty squares)
- 3rd rank: 8 (eight empty squares)
- 2nd rank: 5b2 (five empty squares, Black bishop on f2, two empty squares)
- 1st rank: 8 (eight empty squares)

White's pieces are: King on a4, Queen on f6, Rook on c8, Bishop on g5, Pawns on a5 and e5.
Black's pieces are: King on a7, Queen on h7, Rook on f7, Bishop on f2, Pawns on a6 and b7.

Next, I will consider which of White's pieces can move. White has several pieces that can potentially make legal moves: the king, queen, rook, bishop, and pawns. I will evaluate a few candidate moves to ensure they are legal, meaning they follow the piece's movement rules, do not leave the White king in check, and do not move to a square occupied by another White piece.

1. **Queen moves**: The White queen on f6 has a wide range of movement along files, ranks, and diagonals. One notable move is Qxf7, capturing the Black rook on f7. This move is within the queen's movement rules (moving along the file). The destination square f7 is occupied by a Black piece, which is allowed as it is a capture. I need to check if this move leaves the White king in check. After Qxf7, Black could respond with moves like Qxh2 or other threats, but none of Black's pieces immediately attack the White king on a4 after this move (Black's queen on h7 would need to move to a different diagonal or file to attack a4, and other pieces are not in position to check). So, Qxf7 appears legal.

2. **Rook moves**: The White rook on c8 can move along the c-file or the 8th rank. A possible move is Rc7, moving to c7. This square is empty, and the move follows the rook's movement rules. After Rc7, I check if the White king is in check. Black's pieces do not have an immediate way to attack a4 (Black's queen on h7 is not on the same file or diagonal, and other pieces are blocked or out of range). So, Rc7 is legal.

3. **Bishop moves**: The White bishop on g5 can move along its diagonals. One possible move is Bh6, moving to h6. The square h6 is empty, and the move follows the bishop's movement rules. After Bh6, the White king on a4 is not under immediate threat from Black's pieces. So, Bh6 is legal.

4. **King moves**: The White king on a4 can move one square in any direction. A possible move is Kb3, moving to b3. The square b3 is empty, and the move follows the king's movement rules. I need to ensure that b3 is not under attack by Black's pieces. Black's queen on h7 does not control b3 (different file and diagonal), Black's rook on f7 does not control b3, Black's bishop on f2 does not control b3, and Black's pawns on a6 and b7 do not attack b3. So, Kb3 is legal.

5. **Pawn moves**: The White pawn on a5 can move to a6, capturing the Black pawn if it were on a6, but since a6 is occupied by a Black pawn, the move a5xa6 is a capture and follows pawn rules. After a5xa6, I check if the White king is in check. Black's remaining pieces do not immediately threaten a4. So, a5xa6 is legal.

Having considered several options, I need to pick one legal move. Among the candidate moves, Qxf7 stands out as it captures a Black rook, which is a significant material gain (a rook is worth 5 points). While other moves like Rc7 or Bh6 may have strategic value, capturing a piece is often a strong choice in the absence of an immediate threat or a forced mate. Therefore, I will select Qxf7 as my move.

I double-check the legality: The queen moves from f6 to f7, capturing the Black rook. The path is clear, the destination has an enemy piece, and after the move, Black's responses (like Qxh2 or other moves) do not put the White king in check immediately, as far as I can see. The move notation in PGN/long algebraic form is Qxf7.

Thus, my chosen move for White is Qxf7.
