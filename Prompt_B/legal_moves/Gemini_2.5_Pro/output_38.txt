Here is my reasoning process for selecting a legal move:

1.  **Analyze the FEN string:** `4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R b - - 0 1`
    *   The piece placement is described by `4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R`.
    *   The `b` indicates that it is Black's turn to move.
    *   The `-` indicates that no castling is possible for either side.
    *   The `-` indicates there is no en passant square.
    *   The `0` is the halfmove clock.
    *   The `1` indicates that it is the first move of the game, so Black is making move 1.

2.  **Identify the side to move:** As determined from the FEN, it is Black's turn.

3.  **List potential candidate moves for Black:** I will examine a few pieces and identify some of their legal moves.
    *   **Knight on e4:** This knight can move to several squares. A promising move is to capture the pawn on f2. This move, `...Nxf2`, would also deliver a check to the white king on d1.
    *   **Knight on g4:** This knight can also capture the pawn on f2. This move, `...Nxf2`, would also be a check.
    *   **Pawn on a7:** This pawn can capture the white knight on b6. The move is `...axb6`.
    *   **Bishop on c5:** This bishop can capture the white knight on b6 (`...Bxb6`) or the pawn on f2 (`...Bxf2+`).
    *   **Rook on e8:** The rook can move down the e-file. For example, `...Re2` is a legal move, as is `...Re1+`, which delivers a check.

4.  **Verify the legality of a chosen candidate move:** I will choose the move where the knight on e4 captures the pawn on f2.
    *   **Piece and Movement:** The knight on e4 moves in an 'L' shape to f2. This is a valid knight move.
    *   **Destination Square:** The square f2 is occupied by an enemy pawn, so a capture is legal.
    *   **King Safety:** The move `...Nexf2` does not place the black king on g8 in check.
    *   **Notation:** Since both the knight on e4 and the knight on g4 can move to f2, the move must be disambiguated by specifying the file of origin. The move is `Nexf2`. Since it puts the white king in check, a `+` is added. The full notation, including the move number, is `1... Nexf2+`.

5.  **Conclusion:** The move `1... Nexf2+` is a legal move for Black in the given position.

1... Nexf2+
