1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN `8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1` indicates that it is Black's turn to move ('b').

2.  **List Black's pieces and their potential moves:**
    *   **King on f3:** The king can potentially move to e4, g4, e2, and g2.
    *   **Pawn on e3:** The pawn can move one square forward to e2.
    *   **Pawn on f2:** The pawn is blocked by the White King on f1 and cannot move.

3.  **Check the legality of each potential move:**
    *   **King moves:**
        *   `...Ke4`: This is a legal move. The square e4 is not attacked by any white piece.
        *   `...Kg4`: This is a legal move. The square g4 is not attacked by any white piece.
        *   `...Ke2`: This is an illegal move because the square e2 is attacked by the White King on f1.
        *   `...Kg2`: This is an illegal move because the square g2 is attacked by the White King on f1.
    *   **Pawn moves:**
        *   `...e2`: This is a legal move. The pawn moves one square forward to an empty square. This move also happens to be checkmate.

4.  **Choose one legal move:** From the identified legal moves (`...Ke4`, `...Kg4`, `...e2`), I will select `...e2`.
