This is a reasoning process to arrive at a single legal move for Black in the given position.

1.  **Analyze the FEN string:** The FEN `8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 b - - 0 1` describes the position of the pieces, whose turn it is, castling rights, en passant possibilities, and move counters.
    *   `b` indicates that it is Black's turn to move.
    *   The move number is 1, so the move will be Black's first move in this specific context.

2.  **Identify Black's pieces and their potential moves:**
    *   King on a5: Can move to a6, b6, b5.
    *   Queen on f3: Has many possible moves, including several checks (`...Qc3+`, `...Qe2+`, `...Qd1+`, `...Qf1+`).
    *   Rook on c2: Can move along the c-file and the 2nd rank. It can deliver check with `...Rc1+`.
    *   Bishop on g4: Can move along the light-squared diagonals.
    *   Pawn on a4: Blocked by the White pawn on a3, so it cannot move forward.
    *   Pawn on e4: Can move forward to e3.

3.  **Evaluate candidate moves for legality:** A move is legal if it follows the rules of movement for that piece and does not result in the player's own king being in check.

    *   **Candidate 1: `...e3+`**
        *   **Movement:** The pawn on e4 moves one square forward to e3. This is a valid pawn move.
        *   **Check:** This move is a discovered check. The pawn on e4 was blocking the line of sight from the Black bishop on g4 to the White king on a2. By moving to e3, the pawn uncovers an attack from the bishop, placing the White king in check.
        *   **King Safety:** Does this move leave the Black king on a5 in check? No White piece attacks a5 after the pawn moves to e3.
        *   **Conclusion:** `...e3+` is a legal move.

    *   **Candidate 2: `...Qc3+`**
        *   **Movement:** The queen moves from f3 to c3. This is a valid queen move.
        *   **Check:** The queen on c3 directly attacks the White king on a2.
        *   **King Safety:** The Black king on a5 is not placed in check by this move.
        *   **Conclusion:** `...Qc3+` is a legal move.

    *   **Candidate 3: `...Kb6`**
        *   **Movement:** The king moves from a5 to b6. This is a valid king move.
        *   **Check:** This move does not place the White king in check.
        *   **King Safety:** The square b6 is not attacked by any White piece (Queen on h2, Rook on f2, Bishop on f7, Pawn on a3). Therefore, the move is legal.
        *   **Conclusion:** `...Kb6` is a legal move.

4.  **Select a single legal move:** All the candidates analyzed above are legal. The task is to choose just one. I will select the pawn move `...e3+`. It is a valid and interesting discovered check. The full notation, including the move number, is `1... e3+`.

[FINAL PGN]
1... e3+
