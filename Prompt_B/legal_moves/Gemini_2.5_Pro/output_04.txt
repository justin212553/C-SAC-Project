1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string is `8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1`. The 'b' in the FEN string indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **List Black's pieces:** Black has two pieces on the board: a King on b5 and a Rook on e4.

3.  **Examine possible moves for the Rook:** The Rook on e4 can move along the 4th rank or the e-file. Let's consider a move along the e-file.

4.  **Select a candidate move:** A possible move for the rook is to move from e4 to e1.

5.  **Verify the legality of the move:**
    *   The move follows the rook's movement rules (vertical movement along a file).
    *   The path between e4 and e1 is unobstructed.
    *   The destination square, e1, is empty.
    *   The move does not place Black's own king (on b5) in check.
    *   Therefore, the move is legal.

6.  **Determine the correct notation:** The move is from e4 to e1. In standard algebraic notation, this is written as `Re1`. Since this move attacks the White king on g1, it is a check, so a `+` is added. The full notation for the move is `Re1+`. As it is Black's first move in the sequence, it is written as `1... Re1+`.
