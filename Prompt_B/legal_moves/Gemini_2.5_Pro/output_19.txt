This is a step-by-step reasoning process for choosing a single legal move for White.

1.  **Determine the side to move:** The FEN string `1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1` contains the character 'w', which indicates that it is White's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position for checks:** I need to determine if the White king on b8 is currently in check.
    *   The Black rook on c1 attacks the c-file, but not the square b8.
    *   The Black rook on e2 attacks the e-file and the 2nd rank, neither of which includes b8.
    *   The Black queen on f3 attacks the f-file, the 3rd rank, and the diagonals a8-h1 and b7-g2. None of these lines include the square b8.
    *   All other Black pieces (king, pawns, knight) are too far away to attack the White king.
    *   Therefore, the White king is not in check.

3.  **Identify potential moves:** I will look for a simple, legal move. I will consider the White pawn on a5.

4.  **Evaluate a candidate move:**
    *   The pawn on a5 is a White piece.
    *   According to the rules of chess, a pawn can move one square forward if the destination square is empty.
    *   The square in front of the a5-pawn is a6.
    *   The square a6 is currently unoccupied.
    *   Therefore, the move `a5-a6` is a possible move.

5.  **Confirm the legality of the chosen move:**
    *   The move `a5-a6` follows the movement rules for a pawn.
    *   The move does not result in the White king being in check. Since the king was not in check before the move, and moving the a-pawn does not expose the king to a discovered attack, the move is legal.
    *   The move is to an empty square, not one occupied by another White piece.

6.  **Conclusion:** The move `a5-a6` is a legal move for White. I will select this move for the final answer.
