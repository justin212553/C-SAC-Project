This is a chess position analysis.

**1. Identify the position and whose turn it is.**
The FEN string is `8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1`.
*   Piece placement: Black has a King on g7, a Knight on e5, and a Rook on g5. White has a King on g1, Rooks on f1 and h1, and Pawns on f2, g2, and h2.
*   Side to move: The 'b' indicates it is Black's turn to move.
*   Move number: The final '1' indicates this is the first move of the game.

**2. List Black's pieces and their potential legal moves.**
*   **King on g7:** Can move to f6, f7, f8, g8, h8, h7, or h6. All of these squares are currently safe.
*   **Knight on e5:** Can move to c4, c6, d3, d7, f3, f7, g4, or g6. All of these squares are unoccupied by Black's own pieces, and moving the knight does not place the Black king in check.
*   **Rook on g5:** Can move along the g-file to g6, g4, or g3. It can move along the 5th rank to f5, d5, c5, b5, a5, or h5. All of these are legal moves.

**3. Select one legal move.**
From the list of possible moves, I need to choose just one. A good candidate move is one that is active and improves Black's position. The move `Nf3` is a strong candidate.
*   **Check legality of Nf3:**
    *   The move follows the knight's movement rules (from e5 to f3).
    *   The destination square f3 is empty.
    *   Moving the knight does not expose the Black king on g7 to an attack.
    *   The move attacks the White king on g1, which means it is a check. Therefore, the correct notation is `Nf3+`.
*   The move `Nf3+` is a legal and forcing move. I will choose this move.

**4. Format the final output.**
The move is for Black on move 1. The chosen move is `Nf3+`. In standard PGN notation, this is written as `1... Nf3+`.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Nf3+
