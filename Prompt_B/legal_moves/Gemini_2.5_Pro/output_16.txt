**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The given FEN string is `3k4/7p/pp1P1rp1/4K3/7r/1P1N1b2/P7/R3R3 b - - 0 1`. The 'b' at the end of the FEN indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position:** The White king on e5 is very exposed and is a primary target for Black's pieces. Black has two rooks (on f6 and h4) and a bishop (on f3) that can create immediate threats. White's main threat is the advanced passed pawn on d6.

3.  **List some legal moves for Black:**
    *   **King (d8):** Can move to c8, c7, e8, e7. For example, `Kd8-c7` is a legal move.
    *   **Rook (f6):** Can move along the f-file or the 6th rank. A notable move is `Rf6-f5`, which attacks the White king.
    *   **Rook (h4):** Can move along the h-file or the 4th rank. Moves like `Rh4-f4` or `Rh4-h5` are also checks.
    *   **Bishop (f3):** Can move along its diagonals. For example, `Bf3-e4` is a legal move.
    *   **Pawns (a6, b6, h7):** Can move forward. For example, `a6-a5` is a legal move.

4.  **Select and verify a single legal move:** I will choose the move `Rf6-f5`.
    *   **Is the move valid according to the piece's rules?** Yes, a rook can move vertically from f6 to f5.
    *   **Is the destination square valid?** The square f5 is empty, so the move is possible.
    *   **Does the move leave the king in check?** The Black king on d8 is not under attack after this move.
    *   **Conclusion:** The move is legal. It also puts the White king in check, so the notation will include a '+'.

5.  **Format the output:** The move is for Black on move 1. The chosen move in long algebraic notation is `Rf6-f5+`. Including the move number as requested, the final output will be `1... Rf6-f5+`.
