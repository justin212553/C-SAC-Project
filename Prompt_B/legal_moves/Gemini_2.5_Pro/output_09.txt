1.  **Analyze the position:** The provided FEN is `5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1`.
2.  **Identify the side to move:** The 'w' in the FEN string indicates that it is White's turn.
3.  **List White's pieces and their potential moves:**
    *   **King on e6:** The king can potentially move to d5, d6, d7, e5, e7, f5, g5, g6, g7.
    *   **Pawn on f6:** This pawn is blocked by the pawn on f7 and cannot move.
    *   **Pawn on f7:** This pawn can move forward to f8, where it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight.
4.  **Check the legality of the potential moves:**
    *   **King moves:** The Black king on f8 attacks the squares e7 and g7. Therefore, the White king cannot move to e7 or g7. The moves to d5, d6, d7, e5, and f5 are all legal as these squares are not attacked and are not occupied by White's own pieces. (Note: some of these moves, like Ke5 and Kf5, lead to stalemate, but they are still legal moves).
    *   **Pawn moves:** The move `f8` is legal. Upon reaching the 8th rank, the pawn must be promoted. For example, `f8=Q` is a legal move. This move also delivers check to the Black king.
5.  **Select a single legal move:** From the list of identified legal moves (e.g., `Kd5`, `Kd6`, `Kd7`, `Ke5`, `Kf5`, `f8=Q`, `f8=R`, etc.), I will choose one. The move `Ke5` is a simple, legal move for the king.
