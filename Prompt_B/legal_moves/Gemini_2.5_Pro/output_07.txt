**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Analyze the FEN string:** The FEN `5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1` indicates the piece positions, and the `w` signifies that it is White's turn to move.
2.  **Identify White's pieces:** White has three pieces: a King on g2, a Rook on g4, and a Knight on e4.
3.  **List potential moves for each piece:**
    *   The **King on g2** can move to f1, f2, f3, h1, h2, or h3. None of these squares are under attack.
    *   The **Rook on g4** can move to any empty square along the g-file (g1, g3, g5, g6) or the 4th rank (a4, b4, c4, d4, f4, h4).
    *   The **Knight on e4** can move to c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, or g5.
4.  **Select one legal move:** From the list of possible moves, I will choose a move for the Knight. The move `Ne4-f6` is a valid Knight move.
5.  **Verify the chosen move's legality:**
    *   The destination square f6 is empty.
    *   The move does not place White's own king in check.
    *   The move attacks the Black king on g8, so it is a check.
    *   Therefore, `Nf6+` is a legal move.
