**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string `5r2/2R2P1k/7p/4q3/7K/8/6Q1/8 w - - 0 1` contains the letter 'w' in the active color field. This indicates that it is White's turn to move.
2.  **Analyze the position:** White's king is on h4 and is somewhat exposed. However, White has a very strong attack, with a queen on g2, a rook on c7, and a pawn on f7 that is one square away from promotion. Black's main piece is the queen on e5, which puts pressure on the white king.
3.  **Identify candidate moves:** I will look for legal moves for White. I can consider moves for the King, Queen, Rook, or Pawn.
4.  **Evaluate a candidate move:** Let's consider the move `f8=Q`.
    *   **Piece movement:** The white pawn is on f7. Pawns can move one square forward. Moving from f7 to f8 is a legal pawn move.
    *   **Promotion:** When a pawn reaches the 8th rank, it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight of the same color. Promoting to a Queen (`f8=Q`) is a legal choice.
    *   **Check:** The new queen on f8 attacks the black king on h7. Therefore, this move is a check. The full notation is `f8=Q+`.
    *   **King safety:** This move does not leave the white king in check.
5.  **Conclusion:** The move `f8=Q+` is a legal move according to the rules of chess. It is a strong move that promotes a pawn and puts the opponent in check.
