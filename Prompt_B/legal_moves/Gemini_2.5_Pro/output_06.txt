This is a reasoning process to arrive at a single legal move for Black in the given position.

1.  **Analyze the Position:** The FEN string is `k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1`.
    *   The `b` indicates that it is Black's turn to move.
    *   Black's pieces are: King on a8, pawn on c5, pawn on c4, Bishop on g5, and Rook on h2.
    *   White's pieces are: King on a3 and pawn on b5.
    *   The White King is not currently in check.

2.  **Identify Candidate Moves:** I will list the possible moves for each of Black's pieces.
    *   **King on a8:** Can move to a7, b7, or b8. All three squares are unoccupied and not under attack. So, `...Ka7`, `...Kb7`, and `...Kb8` are legal moves.
    *   **Pawn on c5:** This pawn is blocked by the Black pawn on c4 and has no captures available. It cannot move.
    *   **Pawn on c4:** This pawn can move one square forward to c3. The square c3 is empty. This move (`...c3`) would also put the White King on a3 in check. So, `...c3+` is a legal move.
    *   **Bishop on g5:** It can move along its diagonals to any empty square: `...Bh6`, `...Bf6`, `...Be7`, `...Bd8`, `...Bh4`, `...Bf4`. All of these are legal moves.
    *   **Rook on h2:** It can move along the h-file or the 2nd rank to any empty square. For example, `...Rh1`, `...Rh3`, `...Rg2`, `...Rf2`, `...Rb2`, etc., are all legal moves. Moves like `...Rb2+` and `...Ra2+` would also check the White King.

3.  **Select a Legal Move:** From the many legal options identified, I need to choose just one. The move `...c3+` is a good candidate. It is a simple pawn move, it is legal, and it forces a response from White as it is a check.

    *   The pawn on c4 moves to c3.
    *   The move follows the rules for pawn movement.
    *   The destination square c3 is not occupied by another Black piece.
    *   The move does not leave the Black King in check.

Therefore, `c3+` is a valid and legal move.
