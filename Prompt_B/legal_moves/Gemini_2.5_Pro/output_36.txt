This is a chess position analysis.

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string `6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1` has the letter 'b' in the active color field. This indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position:** The White king on h4 is extremely exposed and vulnerable. The Black rook on g2 and queen on b2 are poised to attack it. White's queen on e3 and rook on c7 are major threats to the Black king, so Black must act decisively. The most forcing moves are checks, as they restrict White's possible replies.

3.  **Consider candidate moves for Black:**
    *   **Qf2+**: This move puts the White king in check. The king has only one legal square to move to: h5 (moving to g3 is met by Qf3#). So, `1... Qf2+ 2. Kh5`. Now Black can play `2... Rg5+`. This is a double check from the rook on g5 and the queen on f2. The king cannot capture the rook because it's protected by the h6 pawn. The king has no escape squares (h4 is covered by the queen, g4 by the pawn, h6 by the pawn). Therefore, `2... Rg5#` is checkmate. Since `1... Qf2+` forces a win, it is an excellent move.
    *   **g5+**: This is another check. The pawn on g6 moves to g5. White's only legal response is `2. Kh5`. This leads to the same mating sequence as above: `2... Qf2+ 3. Kg5 Qf5#`. This is also a winning move.
    *   **Rg1+**: This is also a check. White's only legal response is `2. Kh5`. This again leads to a forced mate, for example `2... Qf2+ 3. Kg5 Qf5#`.
    *   **Kh7**: This is a quiet move that moves the king off the back rank to avoid back-rank mate threats from White's queen and rook. While it is a legal move, it is less forceful than the checking moves which lead to a quick victory.

4.  **Select a single legal move:** All the checking moves (`Qf2+`, `g5+`, `Rg1+`) are legal and lead to a forced checkmate. Any of them would be a correct answer. I will choose `Qf2+` as it is a direct and powerful queen check that initiates a clear and unstoppable mating sequence. The move is legal because the queen can move from b2 to f2, the square is empty, and the move does not place the Black king in check.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qf2+
