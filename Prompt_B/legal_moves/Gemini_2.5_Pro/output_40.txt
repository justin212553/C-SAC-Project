This is a step-by-step reasoning process for choosing a single legal move for Black in the given position.

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string `r3k2r/pQ3pp1/2p3q1/3n4/1n1P2bp/4P3/1P1NNPPP/R1B1KB1R b - - 0 1` contains the letter 'b' in the active color field. This indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position and identify immediate threats:** White's queen on b7 poses a significant and immediate threat. It is attacking Black's rook on a8. If Black does not address this, White can play `Qxa8+`, winning the rook and checking the king. Therefore, a high-priority task for Black is to deal with this threat.

3.  **List potential legal moves:** I will consider several candidate moves for Black, focusing on addressing the threat to the a8 rook.
    *   **Move the rook:** Black can move the threatened rook on a8 to a safe square.
        *   `Rd8`: This moves the rook from a8 to d8. The path is clear, the destination square is empty, and the move does not place the Black king in check. This is a legal move. It also prepares to control the open d-file.
        *   `Rb8`: This moves the rook from a8 to b8. This is also a legal move for the same reasons. It adds pressure to White's b2 pawn.
        *   `Rc8`: This moves the rook from a8 to c8. This is another legal move that saves the rook.
    *   **Counter-attack:** Black can ignore the threat and create a bigger threat of their own.
        *   `Nbc2+`: The knight on b4 moves to c2, delivering a check to the White king on e1. This is a legal move. It forces White to respond to the check, thus preventing `Qxa8+` on the next turn.
    *   **Castling:** The king and rooks are on their starting squares, so castling (`O-O`) might seem like an option. However, the FEN string's castling availability field is `-`, which explicitly states that neither side has castling rights. Therefore, `O-O` is not a legal move.

4.  **Select a single legal move:** From the list of legal candidates, I need to choose one. Moving the threatened rook is a simple, safe, and effective way to solve the immediate problem. `Rd8` is an excellent choice because it not only saves the rook but also improves Black's position by preparing to use the rook on the d-file. It is a clearly legal and logical move.
