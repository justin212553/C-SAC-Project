**1. Identify the side to move:**
The FEN string is `2R5/1KP1R3/1PnP1Q1P/Pn1q2P1/p4P2/8/1pp2ppp/1k1r4 b - - 0 1`. The `b` at the end of the position data indicates that it is Black's turn to move. The fullmove number is `1`, so this is Black's first move of the game.

**2. Assess the king's safety:**
The Black king is located on square b1. We must check if it is currently under attack (in check).
*   The White queen on f6 attacks along the f-file, the 6th rank, and the diagonals a1-h8 and a6-f1. None of these lines of attack target b1.
*   The White rook on c8 attacks the c-file and the 8th rank. It does not attack b1.
*   The White rook on e7 attacks the e-file and the 7th rank. It does not attack b1.
*   No White pawns are in a position to attack b1.
*   The White king on b7 attacks a6, a8, b8, c8, and c7, but not b1.
The Black king is not in check.

**3. Find a legal move:**
Since the king is not in check, any move that follows the rules of chess and does not result in the king being in check is legal. I will look for a simple, unambiguous move. Let's consider moving the Black pawn on a4.
*   The pawn on a4 is a Black piece.
*   It can move one square forward to a3.
*   The square a3 is currently empty.
*   This is a standard pawn move.
*   We must check if this move would put the Black king on b1 in check. Moving the a-pawn does not open up any new lines of attack from White's pieces towards the Black king. Therefore, the king remains safe after the move `a3`.

**4. Select and format the move:**
The move `a3` is a legal move for Black. According to the instructions, the output should be a single move in PGN/long algebraic notation, including the move number. Since it is Black's turn on move 1, the correct format is `1... a3`.

[FINAL PGN]
1... a3
