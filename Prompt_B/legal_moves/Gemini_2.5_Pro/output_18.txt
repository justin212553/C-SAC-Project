This is a chess position analysis.

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string `3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3nP3/2QPqP2/PP3B1P/3R1R1K b - - 0 1` has the character 'b' in the active color field. This indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position:**
    *   Black's queen on e3 is attacked by White's bishop on f2.
    *   Black's knight on d4 is attacked by White's queen on c3.
    *   Black's queen and knight create significant threats to the white king on h1. The f3 pawn is a key defender.
    *   The white king is somewhat exposed.

3.  **Consider candidate moves for Black:**
    *   **Qxf3+**: The black queen captures the pawn on f3.
        *   Is it legal? Yes. The queen moves from e3 to f3, capturing the white pawn. The move puts the white king in check. Black's king is not left in check. This is a legal move.
    *   **Qe2**: The black queen moves to e2.
        *   Is it legal? Yes. The queen moves from e3 to e2. This move attacks the white bishop on f2 and maintains pressure. This is a legal move.
    *   **c5**: The c-pawn moves forward two squares.
        *   Is it legal? Yes. The pawn moves from c7 to c5. This challenges White's central control. This is a legal move.
    *   **Nxf3**: The knight on d4 captures the pawn on f3.
        *   Is it legal? Yes. The knight moves from d4 to f3. This move also puts pressure on the white king. This is a legal move.

4.  **Select a single legal move:** I will choose the move `Qxf3+`. It is a forcing move (a check), a capture, and a very strong tactical blow that puts White under immediate and severe pressure. It is a perfectly legal move according to the rules of chess.
