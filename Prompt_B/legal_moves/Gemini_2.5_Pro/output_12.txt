This is a chess problem. I need to find a single legal move for the side to move.

**1. Analyze the Position**
The given FEN is `4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1`.

*   **Side to move:** The 'b' in the FEN string indicates that it is Black's turn to move.
*   **Black's pieces:** King on c3, Queen on d3, Bishop on d4, Rook on f6.
*   **White's pieces:** King on g1, Rook on h1, Rook on a6, Rook on h7, Bishop on e8, Knight on h8.
*   **King safety:** I must first check if the Black King on c3 is in check.
    *   The White Rook on a6 attacks the a-file and the 6th rank.
    *   The White Rook on h7 attacks the h-file and the 7th rank.
    *   The White Rook on h1 attacks the 1st rank.
    *   The White Bishop on e8 attacks the a4-e8 and h5-e8 diagonals.
    *   The White Knight on h8 attacks f7 and g6.
    *   The White King on g1 attacks f1, f2, g2, h2.
    None of these pieces are attacking the square c3. Therefore, the Black King is not in check.

**2. Identify Candidate Moves**
Since the Black King is not in check, any move that follows the rules of chess and does not place the Black King in check is a legal move. I will list a few possibilities.

*   **King moves (Kc3):** The King can move to any adjacent square that is not attacked. For example, the square b3 is not attacked by any White piece. Therefore, `Kb3` is a legal move.
*   **Queen moves (Qd3):** The Queen has many legal moves. For example, it can move to e4. The square e4 is not attacked, and the move does not expose the Black King to an attack. So, `Qe4` is a legal move.
*   **Bishop moves (Bd4):** The Bishop can move along its diagonals. For example, it can move to e5. This is a legal move. It can also capture the White Knight on h8 (`Bxh8`), which would be a discovered check from the Rook on f6. This is also a legal move.
*   **Rook moves (Rf6):** The Rook can move along the f-file or the 6th rank. It can capture the White Rook on a6 (`Rxa6`). This move is a capture and also puts the White King in check. It does not place the Black King in check. Therefore, `Rxa6+` is a legal move.

**3. Select a Move**
I have identified several legal moves. The task is to choose just one. I will select the move `Rxa6+`. It is a strong, forcing move (a capture and a check) and is clearly legal according to the rules of chess.

*   **Move:** Rook on f6 captures Rook on a6.
*   **Legality Check:**
    1.  The move follows the Rook's movement rules. (Yes)
    2.  The destination square a6 is occupied by an opponent's piece. (Yes, a capture is possible)
    3.  The move does not result in the Black King being in check. (Yes, the King on c3 remains safe)
*   **Conclusion:** The move is legal.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rxa6+
