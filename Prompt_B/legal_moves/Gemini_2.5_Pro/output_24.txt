This is a reasoning process that leads to the chosen move.

1.  **Identify the side to move:** The FEN string is `b2N2k1/6pp/p7/2b5/2p4n/1P3PB1/P5rP/R4R1K b - - 0 1`. The 'b' indicates that it is Black's turn to move.

2.  **Analyze the position for Black:** The White king on h1 is under severe attack. Black's rook on g2 is a major threat, attacking the h2 pawn directly in front of the king. Black's knight on h4 can jump to f3, also checking the king. The White rook on f1 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on c5. This means the f1 rook cannot move off the f-file.

3.  **List candidate moves for Black:**
    *   `...Rxh2+`: The rook on g2 captures the pawn on h2, delivering a check to the White king.
    *   `...Nf3+`: The knight on h4 moves to f3, delivering a check to the White king.
    *   `...cxb3`: The pawn on c4 captures the White pawn on b3.
    *   `...h6`: A simple pawn move.
    *   `...Rg6`: A rook move to prepare further attacks or defend.

4.  **Verify the legality of a chosen move:** I will select the move `...Rxh2+`.
    *   **Movement rules:** A rook moves horizontally and vertically. Moving from g2 to h2 is a legal horizontal move. It also involves a capture of the White pawn on h2, which is a legal action.
    *   **King safety:** The Black king on g8 is not in check. The move `...Rxh2+` does not expose the Black king to any new attack. Therefore, the move is legal.
    *   **Conclusion:** `...Rxh2+` is a perfectly legal move. It is also a very strong attacking move.
