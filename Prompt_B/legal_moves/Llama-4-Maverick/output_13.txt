To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: `8/p1K5/k1P5/8/1p6/3P1P2/5R2/4R3 w - - 0 1`, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string indicates that it's White's turn to move because it contains `w` before the last two fields (`- - 0 1`), where `w` stands for White.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: From the FEN string, we can decode the position:
   - `8` indicates an empty row on the 8th rank.
   - `p1K5` indicates a Black pawn on a7, an empty square on b7, White's King on c7, and empty squares from d7 to h7 on the 7th rank.
   - `k1P5` indicates a Black King on a6, an empty square on b6, a White pawn on c6, and empty squares from d6 to h6 on the 6th rank.
   - `8` indicates an empty row on the 5th rank.
   - `1p6` indicates an empty square on a4 and a Black pawn on b4, with empty squares from c4 to h4 on the 4th rank.
   - `3P1P2` indicates empty squares from a3 to c3, a White pawn on d3, an empty square on e3, a White pawn on f3, and empty squares on g3 and h3 on the 3rd rank.
   - `5R2` indicates empty squares from a2 to e2, a White Rook on f2, and empty squares on g2 and h2 on the 2nd rank.
   - `4R3` indicates empty squares from a1 to d1, a White Rook on e1 on the 1st rank.

   So, White has: King on c7, pawns on c6, d3, f3, Rooks on f2 and e1.

3. **Consider which of White's pieces can move**:
   - The White King on c7 can potentially move to c8, d7, d8 (if not for the presence of other pieces or being in check), but it is somewhat restricted due to its current position and the presence of the Black King on a6.
   - The White pawn on c6 is somewhat restricted but can potentially capture if there were a piece to its left or right, or move forward if possible.
   - The White pawns on d3 and f3 can potentially move forward.
   - The White Rooks on f2 and e1 can move along their respective ranks and files.

4. **Check candidate moves**:
   - The White King can move to d7 or d8. Moving to d7 or d8 doesn't put it in check, and d7 is not occupied by another White piece. So, `Kd7` is a potential move.
   - The White pawn on c6 can move to c7, but it's blocked by the White King. So, it's not a valid move for c6.
   - The White pawn on d3 can move to d4. `d4` is a valid move as it doesn't violate any rules.
   - The White Rooks have potential moves, but we need to check if they put the King in check or not. For example, `Rf7+` could be a check, but we need to verify if it's a valid move.

Let's directly assess a few moves:
- `Kd7` is a valid move as the King is not moving into check and is moving to an adjacent square.
- `Rf7+` is a valid move and puts the Black King in check. It's a good candidate because it also potentially restricts the Black King's movement.

5. **Pick a legal move**: 
   - `1. Rf7+` is a valid and strong move as it checks the Black King. 
   - `1. Kd7` is also valid.

Let's choose `1. Rf7+` as our move because it's a check and an active move.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Rf7+
