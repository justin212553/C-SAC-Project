To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: r5k1/2R3pp/5p2/1p2p3/2b1p3/6P1/5P1P/6KN b - - 0 1, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string "r5k1/2R3pp/5p2/1p2p3/2b1p3/6P1/5P1P/6KN b - - 0 1" indicates that it's Black's turn to move because the 'b' before the last two hyphens signifies that it's Black's move.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: The black pieces are: r (rook), k (king), p (pawns), and b (bishop). Specifically, the position shows a black king on g8, a black rook on a8, black pawns on h7, g7, f6, b5, e5, e4, and a black bishop on c4.

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**: 
   - The black king on g8 can potentially move to f8, h8, or h7 (if not for any other pieces or checks).
   - The black rook on a8 can potentially move along the 8th rank or the 'a' file if not obstructed.
   - The black pawns on h7, g7, f6, b5, and e5 can potentially move forward one or two squares depending on their current position and whether the target squares are occupied.
   - The black bishop on c4 can potentially move along the diagonals it's on.

4. **Check for potential moves and their legality**:
   - The black king is somewhat safe on g8 but could potentially move to f8 or h8. However, we need to check for checks and other potential issues.
   - The white rook on c7 is potentially threatening the black king indirectly, and the white knight on g1 could potentially jump to f3 or h3, but it's not immediately threatening.
   - The black rook on a8 can move to a7 or a6 if not obstructed, but it's blocked by the white rook on c7 on the 8th rank. However, it can potentially move to a7 or other squares along the 'a' file if available.
   - The black pawns have limited mobility due to their positions and potential blockages. For example, the pawn on e4 can potentially move to e3, but it's blocked by the white pawn structure indirectly because e3 is not occupied but moving there might not be beneficial or could be blocked by a potential white piece or not being able to capture.
   - The black bishop on c4 is somewhat restricted. It can potentially move along the diagonals.

5. **Analyze a few candidate moves**:
   - **Kg8-h8**: This is a potential king move. The king is moving to a safer position or at least not directly into danger.
   - **Ra8-a7**: This move is blocked by the white Rook on c7, so it's not possible.
   - **Bxc4**: This is not a valid move as there's no piece to capture on c4 with the bishop, but it could potentially move to other squares like d3, d5, e6, f7, or b3, a2, or b5.
   - **e4-e3**: This is a potential pawn move, but it might be considered weak as it could potentially be captured or is not directly developing.

6. **Select a legal move**: 
   - One of the simplest and most straightforward moves to check is the king moving to a safer position or a pawn move that is safe and doesn't immediately lose material.

Let's directly analyze a simple move: **Kg8-h8**. The king is not moving into check, and it's a valid move according to the king's movement rules.

Let's check if **1... Kh8** is a valid and reasonable move.

The FEN indicates it's Black's turn, so we directly proceed to give the move in PGN format.
