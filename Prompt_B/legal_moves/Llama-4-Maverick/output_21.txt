To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r5k1/2r4p/4pRpP/qP1p4/3Q2P1/5R2/1P6/1K6 w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because it has 'w' before the last two fields.

2. **Understand the position**: The position is: 
   - White: King on b1, Queen on d4, Rook on f3, Rook on g6, Pawns on b2, b5, g4, h6.
   - Black: King on g8, Rook on c7, Queen on a5, Pawns on d5, e6, h7.

3. **Analyze White's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The White King is on b1, relatively safe but somewhat exposed. It can't move to b2 or c1 because those are occupied by other White pieces or would put it in a potentially vulnerable position, but it can potentially move.
   - The White Queen on d4 is active and can potentially move in various directions.
   - The White Rooks are on f3 and g6. The Rook on f3 can potentially move along the f-file or along the third rank. The Rook on g6 is somewhat pinned against the Black Rook on c7 but can still potentially move along the g-file or capture on e6.
   - White Pawns are on b2, b5, g4, and h6. The Pawns on b5 and g4 are somewhat advanced and can potentially capture or be captured.

4. **Consider potential moves and check their legality**:
   - **Qxd5+**: The Queen can capture the Pawn on d5 with check. This is a potential move as it follows the Queen's movement rules, doesn't leave the White King in check, and captures a Black Pawn.
   - Other potential moves include moving the Rooks or advancing Pawns, but we need to check if they are legal and beneficial.

5. **Checking the legality of Qxd5+**:
   - The Queen is on d4 and can move to d5.
   - The square d5 is occupied by a Black Pawn, so it's a capture.
   - After Qxd5+, the Black King is in check. The move doesn't put the White King in check.
   - Thus, Qxd5+ is a legal move.

6. **Choosing a move**: Qxd5+ is a strong candidate because it is a legal move that puts Black in check and captures a Pawn.

Let's output the chosen move in the required format.
