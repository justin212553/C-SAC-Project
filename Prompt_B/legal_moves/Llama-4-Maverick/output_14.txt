To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given ends with "b - - 0 1", indicating that Black is to move because 'b' denotes Black's turn.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: From the FEN notation, we can identify Black's pieces as follows:
   - The 'r' at "4r3" represents a Black Rook on e8.
   - The 'r' at "5r2" represents a Black Rook on f7.
   - The 'p' at "3p1p2" represents Black Pawns on d6 and f6.
   - The 'p' at "K1p5" represents a Black Pawn on c3.
   - The 'k' at "P1k5" represents the Black King on c2.

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**:
   - The Black Rook on e8 can potentially move along the e-file or along the 8th rank.
   - The Black Rook on f7 can potentially move along the f-file or along the 7th rank.
   - The Black Pawns on d6 and f6 can potentially move forward one square.
   - The Black Pawn on c3 is blocked by the White King (not directly, but it's not going to move forward) and cannot move forward; however, it can potentially capture if there were a White piece on b2 or d2, but there aren't any.
   - The Black King on c2 can potentially move to adjacent squares.

4. **Check for legal moves**:
   - For the Rook on e8, moving along the e-file is restricted by the presence of other pieces, but it can potentially move to e7 or e6 if not blocked or capturing. However, it's worth checking if it's blocked or can capture.
   - For the Rook on f7, it can move along the f-file or the 7th rank. It can potentially capture the White Pawn on b7 if it were on b7, but it's actually on b5. So, it can move to f8, f6 (capture the Pawn), f5, f4, f3, f2, or f1.
   - For the Pawns on d6 and f6, they can move to d5 and f5, respectively, as there are no pieces directly in front of them.

5. **Mentally check a few candidate moves**:
   - Rook on e8 to e7 or e6 or other squares along the e-file. Let's check e7: It's a valid move as there's no piece on e7.
   - Rook on f7 to f8, f6, or other squares. Let's check f6: It's a valid capture.
   - Pawn on d6 to d5: It's a valid move as b5 is occupied by a White Pawn but doesn't directly block d5.
   - Pawn on f6 to f5: It's a valid move.

6. **Check if the chosen move follows the rules and doesn't put the King in check**:
   - Moving the Rook on e8 to e7 is valid and doesn't seem to put the King in check directly.
   - Capturing on f6 with the Rook on f7 is valid and doesn't directly put the King in check.
   - Moving the Pawn on d6 to d5 is valid and doesn't put the King in check.

Let's pick a simple and safe move: **1... Rf6**. It's a valid move as the Rook can capture the Pawn on f6.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rf6
