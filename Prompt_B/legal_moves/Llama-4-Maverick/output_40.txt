To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r3k2r/pQ3pp1/2p3q1/3n4/1n1P2bp/4P3/1P1NNPPP/R1B1KB1R b - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move since 'b' is specified as the side to move.

2. **Understand the position**: 
   - Black's king is on e8, and it's not castled.
   - Black has a queen on g6, knights on d5 and b4, and other pieces on various squares.
   - White has a queen on b7, among other pieces.

3. **Consider Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The Black king on e8 can potentially move to c8 or d8 or d7 (if safe).
   - The Black queen on g6 can potentially move to various squares.
   - The knights on d5 and b4 can potentially move to various squares.

4. **Analyze potential moves for Black**:
   - **King**: Moving the king to c8 or d8 seems plausible as it gets the king out of the potentially vulnerable e-file. However, we need to check if these moves are safe and legal.
   - **Queen on g6**: The queen can potentially move. Checking its possible moves, it can move to other squares on the g-file or along the sixth rank. However, we need to check for legality and safety.
   - **Knights**: Checking the knights' possible moves. The knight on d5 can potentially jump to other squares, and so can the knight on b4.

5. **Checking for checks and captures**:
   - The Black king is somewhat exposed on e8. White's queen on b7 is putting pressure, but it's not directly checking the king. However, it's worth considering moves that might alleviate this pressure or improve Black's position.
   - One potential issue is the White queen's position on b7, which is somewhat aggressive. Black might want to consider a move that addresses this or improves their development.

6. **Specific move analysis**:
   - Let's examine moving the Black king to a safer position. Ke8-d8 is a potential move as it moves the king away from the potentially vulnerable e-file and into a somewhat safer position.
   - Checking the legality of Ke8-d8: The king is not moving into check, it's not castling, and it's moving to an adjacent square. This move is legal.

7. **Other potential moves**:
   - Checking other pieces, like the queen on g6 or the knights, to see if there are better moves. For instance, Nb4-a2 or Nc2 is not possible due to the presence of other pieces or the fact that it's not a valid move for the knight. 
   - Qg6-e6 or Qg6-f6 could be considered to develop or reposition the queen, but let's first verify if there's an immediate need or a better alternative.

8. **Selecting a move**:
   - After considering various factors, one of the simplest and most straightforward legal moves is to move the Black king from e8 to d8.
