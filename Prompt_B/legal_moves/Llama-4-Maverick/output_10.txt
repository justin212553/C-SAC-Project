To determine the legal move for the given chess position in FEN format: 8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given is "8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1". The 'b' in the notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: From the FEN, we can see that Black has a king (k), a pawn on f3 (noted as 'p'), and another pawn on f2.

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**: 
   - The Black king is on e3. It can potentially move to d3, d2, e2, f2, f3, f4, d4, or e4, provided these moves are legal.
   - The Black pawn on f3 is blocked by the White king and cannot move forward, so it's not a candidate for a move.
   - The Black pawn on f2 can potentially move to f1, either by moving directly to f1 if it's unoccupied or by capturing if there's a White piece on f1.

4. **Check the legality of potential moves**:
   - For the Black king on e3, moving to d2 or d3 would put it in a potentially safer position, but we need to check if these moves are legal. The White king is on f1, so d2 is a valid square to consider as it's not directly next to the White king.
   - The Black pawn on f2 can move to f1. Since there's no White piece on f1 and it's not occupied by a Black piece, this is a potential move. However, the pawn needs to promote as it's reaching the first rank.

5. **Evaluate specific moves**:
   - The Black king moving to d3 or d2 is a possibility. Let's check: Moving to d3 is legal as it doesn't put the king in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece. The White king is too far to directly threaten it.
   - The Black pawn on f2 can promote by moving to f1. It can promote to any piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight). The most powerful promotion would be to a Queen.

6. **Select a legal move**:
   - The Black king can move to d3. This is a valid move as it doesn't put the king in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece.
   - The Black pawn promoting to f1 is another valid action. Promoting to a Queen is the most powerful option.

Let's pick one of these valid moves. The move "1... f1=Q+" is a valid and strong move because it promotes the pawn to a Queen and puts the White king in check. However, we need to check if it's the most straightforward legal move to output.

Since the task is to output a single move in PGN format with move numbers, and given that it's Black's first move (as indicated by "0 1" in the FEN, meaning it's the first move for Black), the correct notation should start with "1...".
