To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move because the third character from the end is 'b', signifying Black.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: The Black pieces are the king on b5 and the rook on e4.

3. **Consider possible moves for Black's pieces**:
   - The Black king on b5 can potentially move to b4, b6, a4, a5, or a6, provided these moves are legal.
   - The Black rook on e4 can potentially move along the e-file or along the 4th rank, provided these moves are legal.

4. **Check legality of potential king moves**:
   - Moving the king to b4 or b6 would be legal as there are no pieces on those squares and they are not under attack.
   - Moving to a4, a5, or a6 might be legal, but we need to check if they are under attack or occupied.

5. **Check legality of potential rook moves**:
   - The rook can move along the e-file. Potential moves include e1, e2, e3, e5, e6, e7, and e8, provided they are not occupied by the same color or would put the king in check.
   - The rook can also move along the 4th rank. Potential moves include d4, c4, b4, and a4, with the same provisos.

6. **Detailed check**:
   - The Black king is on b5. It's not in check, so we don't have to worry about getting out of check. Let's check the potential moves for the king and the rook.
   - The king can move to b4, b6, a5, or a4 (since a6 is not adjacent, it's not considered). a4 is under attack by the White king (if it were closer), but here it's not an issue as the White king is far. However, b4 is a safe move.
   - The rook on e4 can move to various squares, but let's check if it can capture or move to a safe square. It can move to e3, but that's not a good move as it's blocked by a potential White pawn structure. It can move to e1, e2, or e3 (though e3 is somewhat dubious due to the White pawns), or along the 4th rank.

7. **Specific move selection**:
   - Let's examine a potential move for the Black king: Kb4 is a valid move as it doesn't put the king in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece.
   - For the rook, Re1+ is a check, but we need to verify if it's a valid and good move. The White king is on g1, so Re1 is not check because the White king is not on the e-file and is not in a position to be checked by Re1 directly.

8. **Choosing a move**:
   - Kb4 is a valid and safe move for the Black king.
   - Re1 is not check, but it's a valid move. However, we should check if there's a better move.

Given the position and the analysis, a valid and straightforward move is **1... Kb4**.

Let's output this in the required format:

[FINAL PGN]
1... Kb4
