To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: `8/1Q4R1/p3q2p/5ppk/8/4P1PP/2r5/6K1 w - - 0 1`.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because the side to move is denoted by 'w' (for White) or 'b' (for Black), and here it's 'w'.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: White has a Queen (Q) on b7, a Rook (R) on g7, a Pawn on e3, another Pawn on g3, and a King on g1.

3. **Consider the movement of White's pieces**:
   - The Queen on b7 can move along the rank, file, or diagonals it's on. It can potentially capture the Black Queen on e6 or the Black Rook on c2 if not for other pieces or if it's a legal move.
   - The Rook on g7 can move along the g-file or the 7th rank. It's somewhat limited by the presence of other pieces and the edges of the board.
   - The Pawns on e3 and g3 are blocked by other pieces or are not on open files to advance freely.
   - The King on g1 is somewhat safe but can potentially move to f1 or h1, or even f2, depending on the checks or captures available.

4. **Analyze potential moves for White's pieces**:
   - The White Queen can potentially capture the Black Queen on e6. This is a significant capture as it removes a key Black piece.
   - The move Qxe6 follows the Queen's movement rules (diagonal in this case), does not leave the White King in check (since Black's pieces don't seem to be putting the White King in check directly), and is not capturing one of White's own pieces.

5. **Check if Qxe6 is a valid move**: 
   - The Queen is on b7, and e6 is on the same diagonal.
   - There's no piece between b7 and e6 to block the capture.
   - It's not moving onto a square occupied by another White piece.

6. **Conclusion**: Qxe6 is a valid and significant move for White.

Let's format this as per the instructions:
