To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given is "k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1". The 'b' in the notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move.

2. **Identify the pieces of the side to move**: Black has a king (k), three pawns (p), a bishop (b), and a rook (r).

3. **Consider the positions of Black's pieces**:
   - The Black king is on a8.
   - The Black pawns are on b5, c5, and c4.
   - The Black bishop is on f5.
   - The Black rook is on h2.

4. **Analyze possible moves for Black's pieces**:
   - The Black king can move from a8 to b8 or a7 because it's not in check and those squares are not occupied by other Black pieces.
   - The pawns on b5 and c4 are blocked by other Black pawns or are on the edge of the board in terms of pawn movement capability. The pawn on c5 can potentially move to c4, but it's already on c5, so it can move forward if not blocked. However, c4 is occupied by another Black pawn, so it cannot move forward. 
   - The Black bishop on f5 can potentially move along its diagonals.
   - The Black rook on h2 can potentially move along the h-file or on the second rank.

5. **Check for legality**:
   - For the king: Moving to b8 or a7 are valid if not putting the king in check. The White king is on a3, and there are no other White pieces that could potentially put the Black king in check on b8 or a7. So, Ka8-b8 or Ka8-a7 are potentially legal.
   - For the pawns: As noted, the c5-pawn cannot move forward due to the pawn on c4. The b5-pawn is similarly blocked in terms of forward movement.
   - For the bishop: The bishop on f5 can move along the diagonals it's on. One potential move is Bf5-e4, which is a valid diagonal move.
   - For the rook: The rook on h2 can move along the second rank or the h-file. A potential move is Rh2-h8, moving along the h-file.

6. **Select a legal move**: 
   - Ka8-b8 is a valid move as it doesn't put the king in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece.
   - Bf5-e4 is a valid move as it's a diagonal move for the bishop and not blocked by other Black pieces.
   - Rh2-h8 is a valid move as it's along the h-file and not blocked.

Given these considerations, a simple and valid move is **1... Ka8-b8**.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Ka8-b8
