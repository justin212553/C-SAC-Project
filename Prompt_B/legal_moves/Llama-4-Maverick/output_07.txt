To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string indicates that it's White's turn to move because it contains 'w' before the last two fields that denote the castling rights and the en passant square.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: From the FEN, we can see the White pieces are: N (Knight) on e4, R (Rook) on g4, and K (King) on g2.

3. **Consider which of White's pieces can move**:
   - The White King on g2 can potentially move.
   - The White Knight on e4 can potentially move.
   - The White Rook on g4 can potentially move.

4. **Check potential moves for legality**:
   - **White King (g2)**: Can move to f1, f2, f3, g1, g3, h1, h2, or h3. It cannot move to f1 or h1 as it would be moving into check from the Black Rook on f8 or potentially putting itself in a more dangerous position, but we need to check if it's actually in check or not. The King is not in check currently. Let's check a potential safe move: Kg3 is a potential move.
   - **White Knight (e4)**: Can move to c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, or g5. Let's check a few: Nd6 and Ng3 and Nf6 and Nc5 and Nc3 are potential moves. Ng3 is particularly interesting because it develops the Knight and somewhat centralizes it, but we need to check if it's the best or a legal move. 
   - **White Rook (g4)**: Can move along the g-file or along the 4th rank. Potential moves include Rg3, Rg5, Rg6, Rg7, Rg8, Rh4, h4 is occupied by a Black pawn but that's not a valid concern here as it's not a White piece, however, h4 is not a valid square due to the presence of the Black pawn. Let's check a few: Rg5, Rg6, Rg7, Rg8 are potential moves.

5. **Check the legality of a few candidate moves**:
   - For the White King: Kg3 is a valid move as it doesn't put the King in check and is not onto a square occupied by another White piece.
   - For the White Knight: Ng3 is a valid move as it follows the Knight's movement and doesn't put the King in check. However, it blocks the Rook's potential path to g3.
   - For the White Rook: Rg7 is a valid move. It captures a Black pawn.

6. **Pick a legal move**: Let's pick a simple and safe move. The Rook on g4 can move to g7 (Rxg7), capturing a pawn. This is a straightforward and legal move.

Let's output the chosen move in the required format.
