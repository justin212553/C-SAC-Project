To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move because the letter 'b' is present after the piece placement description, which denotes that it's Black's move.

2. **Understand the position**: The position is quite complex, with several pieces on the board for both sides. Black is to move.

3. **List the pieces Black can move**:
   - Black has a knight on d4.
   - Black has a bishop on g4 and another on h4.
   - Black has a rook on c2.
   - Black has pawns on c6, e5, g6, and h6.

4. **Analyze potential moves for these pieces**:
   - The knight on d4 can potentially move to several squares (b3, b5, c6, e2, e6, f3, f5), but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - The bishop on g4 can move along its available squares, potentially to e2, f3, f5, h3, or h5, if not blocked or capturing an opponent's piece.
   - The bishop on h4 can potentially move to other squares on the diagonal or along the rank/file if not restricted.
   - The rook on c2 can potentially move along the c-file or on the second rank.
   - The pawns have limited mobility based on their position and the presence of other pieces.

5. **Check for legality and potential threats**:
   - The Black king is on h8, and it's not in check. A priority is to ensure it remains safe.
   - White has a strong presence with a knight on e8 and rooks on g7 and f2, among other pieces.

6. **Consider a few candidate moves**:
   - Moving the knight from d4. Potential moves include Nb3, Nb5, Ne2, Ne6, Nf3, Nf5. Let's check if any of these are viable.
   - Checking the move Nf3: It's a valid move as it follows the knight's movement rules and doesn't put the Black king in check or capture one of Black's pieces on f3 (since it's empty). It also doesn't move onto a square occupied by another Black piece.

7. **Select a legal move**:
   - One of the simplest moves to check is Nf3. The knight moves from d4 to f3, which is a valid knight move. It's not capturing a White piece, but it's a developing move and puts the knight on a relatively safe square.

Let's verify if the move "1... Nf3" is in standard PGN notation and includes the move number for Black's move correctly.

The move is for Black, so it should be represented as "1... Nd4-f3" or simply checking if "Nf3" is a valid response.
