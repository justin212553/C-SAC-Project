To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 2R5/1KP1R3/1PnP1Q1P/Pn1q2P1/p4P2/8/1pp2ppp/1k1r4 b - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation given ends with "b - - 0 1", indicating it's Black's turn to move because 'b' stands for Black.

2. **Understand the position**: The given position is quite complex, with several pieces on the board for both White and Black. We need to identify the pieces that Black can move.

3. **List Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - Black has a King on b1, a Queen on d5, a Knight on b6 (and another on b5), a Rook on d1, and several Pawns.
   - The King is somewhat exposed but has some protection.
   - The Queen is relatively active on d5.
   - The Knights are somewhat restricted but can potentially move.
   - The Rook on d1 is somewhat active.
   - The Pawns are mostly on their starting or second rank, with some flexibility to move.

4. **Analyze potential moves for Black**:
   - The Black King (b1) can potentially move to a1 or c1, or even to c2 if it's safe.
   - The Black Queen (d5) has several potential moves, given its relatively central and open position.
   - The Knights (b6 and b5) have limited mobility due to the presence of other pieces and Pawns.
   - The Rook (d1) is somewhat pinned against the White Rook on e7 or potentially the Queen, but it can still move along the d-file.
   - The Pawns have limited mobility, especially due to the presence of White Pawns and other pieces.

5. **Checking specific moves**:
   - Moving the King to a1 or c1 could be considered, but it needs to be checked if it's safe from checks or captures.
   - The Queen on d5 can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check for legality and safety.
   - Let's examine a potential Queen move: Qd5-a2 seems like a significant move, putting the Queen on a relatively safer square and potentially putting pressure on White.

6. **Checking the legality of Qd5-a2**:
   - The Queen can move to a2 as it's along the diagonal and rank/file paths allowed for a Queen.
   - It doesn't put the King in check directly since White's pieces aren't directly threatening the King from the Queen's new position.
   - It doesn't capture one of Black's pieces.

7. **Selecting a move**: After considering the pieces and potential moves, one of the simpler and more straightforward moves for Black is to move the Queen from d5 to a2, which is a legal and potentially strategic move.

The move is: 1... Qa2+

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qa2+
