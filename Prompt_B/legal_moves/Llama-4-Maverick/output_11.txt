To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 7r/8/2KQ4/3B4/8/r4R2/7r/4b1nk w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because the third field (after splitting by spaces) is 'w', standing for White.

2. **Understand the position**: The given position is quite complex, with several pieces on the board. White's King is on c6, Queen on d6, and Bishop on d5. There are other pieces on the board as well, including a White Rook on f3.

3. **Identify potential moves**: 
   - The White King (c6) can potentially move to c5, c7, b5, b6, b7 (if not for other pieces or checks).
   - The White Queen (d6) is somewhat restricted due to the presence of the White King and other pieces but can potentially move along the d-file or diagonally.
   - The White Bishop (d5) is somewhat restricted and can potentially move along the diagonals it's on.
   - The White Rook (f3) can move along the f-file or horizontally on the third rank.

4. **Analyze the pieces and potential moves**:
   - The White King is relatively safe on c6 but has limited mobility. It can move to b6 or b7, but we need to check for legality.
   - The White Queen on d6 is somewhat pinned against the Black Rook on h8, but directly capturing the Rook is not an option. It can potentially move, but its movement is restricted.
   - The White Bishop on d5 is not directly attacking any Black pieces but controls some central squares.
   - The White Rook on f3 is in a relatively active position and can potentially capture the Black Rook on a3 or move to other squares on the third rank or along the f-file.

5. **Checking for legal moves**:
   - Let's check a few potential moves:
     - The White Queen can potentially move to other squares, but we need to check if any of those moves are legal and beneficial.
     - The Rook on f3 can capture the Black Rook on a3. This is a potential move as it follows the Rook's movement rules and doesn't immediately appear to put the White King in check or capture one of White's own pieces.

6. **Selecting a move**:
   - One of the simplest and most straightforward legal moves is to capture the Black Rook on a3 with the White Rook on f3. The move is Rxa3.

7. **Formatting the move**:
   - The move number is 1 (since it's the first move), and it's White's move. So, the move should be formatted as "1. Rxa3".

Let's now output the chosen move.
