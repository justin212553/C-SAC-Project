To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format (8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 b - - 0 1), let's first decode the information provided by the FEN notation.

1. **Position Decoding**:
   - The board position is described by the string "8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5".
     - "8" means eight empty squares on the rank.
     - "5B2" means five empty squares, followed by a Bishop on the white square (since it's on a light square, implying it's a white Bishop if we were to determine the color, but here it indicates the square), and then two empty squares.
     - "k" represents the black King.
     - "p" represents black Pawns.
     - "P" represents white Pawns.
     - "Q" represents the white Queen.
     - "R" represents the white Rook.
     - "r" represents the black Rook.
     - "q" represents the black Queen.
     - "b" represents the black Bishop.
     - "K" represents the white King.
     - "B" represents the white Bishop.
   - The position is: 
     - Black King on a7 (a8 is empty, and there's a "k" on the 7th rank, on "a").
     - Other pieces are similarly placed.

2. **Side to Move**:
   - The FEN string "8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 **b** - - 0 1" indicates it's Black's turn to move because of the "**b**".

3. **Available Pieces and Potential Moves**:
   - Black has a King on a7, a Pawn on a4 and another on e4, a Bishop on b1 (though it seems like it should be on a square like b4 or similar, given the "b1" in the FEN, it is actually on g4 or a similar square, let's correct this: it's actually on g4 or a similar dark square, so "b1" is a misinterpretation. The correct interpretation is that there's a black Bishop on a square like g4), a Queen on f3, and a Rook on c1.

4. **Checking Legal Moves**:
   - The black King (a7) can potentially move to a6 or b7 or b6, but we need to check if these moves leave it in check or are otherwise illegal.
   - The black Queen (f3) can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check for legality.
   - The black Rook (c1) can potentially move along the c-file or along the first rank.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:
- The black King is somewhat safe on a7 but can potentially move. Let's check: 
  - Moving to a6 or b7 or b6 doesn't immediately appear to put it in check from the given position.
- The white King is on a2, and there's a white Queen on h2, which could potentially check or pin pieces.
- The black Queen on f3 is attacking the white King on a2. 
- The white Rook on f2 is somewhat pinned or limited by the black Queen.

Let's directly check some moves:
- **King Moves**: Ka7-a6 or Ka7-b6 could be considered, but we need to check if they are in check or not. The white Queen on h2 could potentially check the King if it moves to certain squares.
- **Queen Moves**: Qf3xa3+ is a check (since the white King is on a2 and a3 is a potential check). This is a potential move as it puts the white King in check.
- **Other Pieces**: The Rook on c1 could potentially move, but there are no obvious safe or beneficial moves without putting itself or the King in danger.

Let's directly check the legality of a few moves:
1. **Qf3xa3+**: This is a check. The white King can potentially capture the Queen or interpose a piece. It's a valid move.

2. **Ka7-a6 or Ka7-b6**: These need to be checked for check. The white Queen can potentially check the King.

Let's directly evaluate **Qf3xa3+**:
- It's a check.
- The white King is on a2, so it's a valid check.

Let's directly go to the final output with the chosen move.
