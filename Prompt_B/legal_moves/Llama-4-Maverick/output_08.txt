To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1.

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move because the letter 'b' is present after the piece placement description.

2. **Understand the position**: The position is as follows: Black has a king on g7 and pieces on e5 (knight) and g5 (rook). White has pawns on f2, g2, and h2, and rooks on f1 and g1, with the king on h1.

3. **Analyze Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The Black king is on g7. It can potentially move to f6, f7, f8, h7, or h8, as long as it doesn't put itself in check.
   - The Black knight on e5 can move to c4, c6, d3, d7, f3, g4, g6, or other squares following a knight's movement pattern, provided they are not occupied by other Black pieces and the move is otherwise legal.
   - The Black rook on g5 can move along the g-file or along the 5th rank, as long as it's not blocked by other Black pieces or putting the king in check.

4. **Checking potential moves**:
   - For the Black king: Moving to f6, f7, f8, h7, or h8 is possible. Let's check if any of these put it in check or are otherwise illegal. The White rooks could potentially check the king if it moves into their line. The king can move to f7 or h7 without being in check directly from the current White piece positions.
   - For the Black knight: It can potentially move to various squares. Let's check a few. For example, moving to c6, d7, f3, or g6 could be considered. However, we need to check if these moves are legal and safe.
   - For the Black rook: It can potentially move along the g-file or the 5th rank. Checking some of these moves: Rg8, Rg6, Rg4, Rg3, Rg2 (capturing a pawn), Rh5, and other moves along the 5th rank.

5. **Checking legality and safety**:
   - Let's consider a few specific moves:
     - **Kg7-f7 or Kg7-h7**: These are potential king moves. The king is somewhat safer on g7 than on f7 or h7 due to the potential for White to check or attack.
     - **Rg5-g8 or Rg5-g6 or Rg5-g4 or Rg5-g3 or Rg5-g2**: These are potential rook moves. Rg2 captures a pawn and is a good candidate because it gains material.
     - **Ne5-g6 or Ne5-f3**: These are potential knight moves. Nf3 is interesting because it attacks the White rook on f1 and could potentially fork the king and rook if White's position is not careful.

6. **Selecting a move**:
   - Let's examine **Rg5-g2** as a potential move. The rook can move to g2, capturing the White pawn. This is a legal move as it follows the rook's movement rules, doesn't leave the Black king in check, and captures a White pawn.

7. **Output the chosen move in PGN format**:
   - The chosen move is **1... Rg2**.
