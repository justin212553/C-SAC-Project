To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1.

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation given is in the format that includes the side to move. Here, 'b' indicates it's Black's turn.

2. **Understand the position**: The current position is:
   - Black's king is on g8.
   - White has a Rook on c7 and a Queen on e3, among other pieces.
   - Black has a Queen on b2 and a Rook on g2, among other pieces.

3. **Assess Black's situation**: Black is to move. The Black king is somewhat exposed on g8 but is somewhat defended by the pawns on f6 and h6. However, the presence of White's Rook on c7 and Queen on e3 poses a threat.

4. **Consider Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The Black Queen on b2 is somewhat active but is not directly attacking any major White pieces. It can potentially move.
   - The Black Rook on g2 is under some threat from White's Queen and potentially could be captured if it moves along the g-file. However, it can potentially move along the g-file or to the second rank.
   - Other Black pieces include pawns on e6, f6, and h6.

5. **Check for immediate threats and potential moves**:
   - White's Queen on e3 is somewhat active and can potentially move to attack or defend.
   - The White Rook on c7 is putting pressure on the Black position and could potentially be a problem if Black's king moves or if other Black pieces are developed.

6. **Analyze potential Black moves**:
   - Moving the Black Queen: It can potentially move to various squares. Checking for safe moves, it can move to c1, c2, c3, d2, d4, e2, e5, f2 (not possible due to White's King being on a somewhat similar file but blocked by other pieces), or other squares along its possible moves.
   - The Black Rook on g2 can move along the g-file or to the second rank. However, moving it along the g-file might expose it to White's Queen.

7. **Checking a few candidate moves for legality**:
   - Qc1+ is a potential check, but we need to verify if it's safe and doesn't put the Black King in a worse position upon White's response.
   - Qe5 is another potential move, putting the Queen in a somewhat central and relatively safe position.

Let's directly assess a simple and potentially safe move: 
- The Black Queen can move to a square like c2 or c3, but we need to check if it's the best or a legal move.

Upon closer inspection:
- **Qc2** is a valid move as it follows the Queen's movement rules and doesn't immediately appear to put the Black King in check or move onto a square occupied by another Black piece.

Let's verify if **Qc2** is a valid and reasonable move:
- It is within the Queen's movement capabilities.
- It doesn't directly put the Black King in check.
- The square c2 is not occupied by another Black piece.

Thus, a valid move for Black is **Qc2**.
