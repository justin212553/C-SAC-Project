To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r5k1/pb4bp/1p1N1pp1/3nN3/3p4/P2Q2Pq/1P3P1P/R1B1rBK1 b - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move since 'b' is specified as the side to move.

2. **Assess the position**: The current position is r5k1/pb4bp/1p1N1pp1/3nN3/3p4/P2Q2Pq/1P3P1P/R1B1rBK1. Let's decode it:
   - Black's king is on g8.
   - Black has a rook on e1, a knight on d5, a queen on h3, and other pieces on the board.
   - White's king is on g1, making it potentially exposed due to Black's queen on h3.

3. **Consider Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The Black queen on h3 is already putting pressure on White's position and is somewhat constrained but can potentially move.
   - The Black rook on e1 is on an open file and is pinning the White f1 bishop against the White king, but it's actually not a legal move for the rook to capture the bishop because the king is on g1. However, it's still a strong piece.
   - The Black knight on d5 is well-placed in the center.

4. **Checking for immediate threats and potential moves**:
   - White's king is somewhat exposed, and the Black queen is already in an aggressive position on h3. However, moving the queen away might not be the best as it's already putting pressure.
   - The Black rook on e1 is under attack by the White knight on d6 (if we consider Nd6 as a potential previous move, though the actual previous move isn't given). However, the White piece attacking it is actually a knight on e5. The rook is not under attack directly by any piece that can capture it without being captured back or being protected.
   - The Black knight on d5 is not under immediate attack.

5. **Evaluating potential moves**:
   - Moving the Black queen (Qh3) is a consideration. It can potentially move to other squares like g4 or f5, but let's check if it's a good move.
   - Qg4 seems like a potential move as it maintains pressure and potentially attacks White's position.
   - Other pieces like the rook on e1 can potentially move, but it's somewhat restricted due to the need to either stay on the e-file or potentially capture on f1 if the situation allowed.

6. **Checking legality and selecting a move**:
   - Let's check if Qg4 is a valid move: The queen can move from h3 to g4. It's a valid move as per the queen's movement rules (diagonally, horizontally, or vertically). It doesn't put the Black king in check, and g4 is not occupied by a Black piece.

7. **Selecting the final move**:
   - The move Qg4 is a valid and reasonable choice. It maintains the pressure and is a safe move.

Let's format the move according to the instructions.
