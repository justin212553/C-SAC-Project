To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R b - - 0 1.

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move since 'b' is specified as the side to move.

2. **Assess the position**: The position is as follows:
   - Black's king is on g8.
   - Black has a rook on e8, a bishop on c5, a knight on e4, and another knight on g4.
   - White has a king on c1, a queen on d3, a knight on f3, and other pieces on the board.

3. **Consider Black's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The rook on e8 can potentially move along the e-file or to other available squares on its rank.
   - The bishop on c5 is somewhat restricted due to the presence of White's pawn on d5 but can potentially move to other squares on the a7-g1 diagonal or other available squares.
   - The knights on e4 and g4 have various potential moves given their positions.

4. **Check for immediate threats and constraints**:
   - The Black king is somewhat exposed but not directly under attack at the moment.
   - White's king is on c1, which is a relatively safe position given the current setup.

5. **Analyze potential moves for Black**:
   - **Re8**: Moving the rook is a possibility, but it is already on e8, so it can move to other squares on the e-file or elsewhere if available. However, moving it might expose the king or not achieve much if it moves away.
   - **Bxd5**: Capturing the pawn on d5 with the bishop is a potential move. It follows the bishop's movement rules and doesn't seem to put the Black king in a worse position directly.
   - **Nxf3** or **Nxh2**: The knights can potentially capture White's pieces. Nxf3 is a plausible move as it captures a White knight and follows the knight's movement rules.
   - Other moves like **Nh6** or **Ne5** (for the knights) or moving the bishop to a safer or more active square could be considered.

6. **Check the legality of a few candidate moves**:
   - **Bxd5**: This move captures a pawn and is a straightforward choice. It doesn't appear to leave the Black king in check or move onto a square occupied by another Black piece.
   - **Nxf3**: This captures a White knight, potentially weakening White's position. It is a valid move as it follows the knight's movement rules.

7. **Select a legal move**: 
   - Upon reviewing, **Nxf3** is a valid and reasonable move. It captures a White piece, potentially weakening White's control over the center and developing the Black knight further.

Let's format the chosen move in PGN notation.
