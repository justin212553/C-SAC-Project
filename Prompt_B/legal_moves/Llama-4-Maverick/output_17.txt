To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 3r1r1k/pp3b1p/2qpQp2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because it says "w" before the last two fields.

2. **Understand the position**: The position is: 
   - White: King on g1, Queen on e6, Knight on d5, Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2, Rook on d1, Rook on f1.
   - Black: King on k8 (h8), Queen on d6, Bishop on f7, Pawns on a7, b7, f6, g7, h7, Rook on d8, Rook on f8.

3. **Assess the pieces that can move for White**: 
   - The White Queen on e6 can potentially move.
   - The White Knight on d5 can potentially move.
   - The White Rooks on d1 and f1 can potentially move.

4. **Check potential moves for legality**:
   - **White Queen (e6)**: Can potentially capture on d6 or f6 or move to other squares along its movement paths (diagonals, ranks, or files). It is currently putting the Black King in a potential pin or directly checking it if it were on the same rank or diagonal. Checking its movement, Qxd6 is a valid capture.
   - **White Knight (d5)**: Can potentially move to b4, b6, c3, c7, e3, e7, f4, or f6. Checking its movement, it can capture on c7 or f6. Nxf6 and Nc7 are potential moves, but we need to check if they are legal.
   - **White Rooks**: The Rook on d1 can potentially move along the d-file. The Rook on f1 is somewhat restricted due to the King being on g1, but it can potentially move along the f-file.

5. **Checking specific moves**:
   - **Qxd6**: This is a valid move as the Queen can capture the Black Queen on d6. It's a straightforward and legal move.
   - Other potential moves like Nxf6, Nc7, or moving the Rooks need to be checked for legality, but capturing the Black Queen is a significant advantage.

6. **Selecting a move**: 
   - **Qxd6** is a legal and advantageous move as it captures the Black Queen.

Let's format this as per the instructions.
