To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 8/6q1/8/7k/4Q3/7P/2r2p1K/5R2 b - - 0 1, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given is "8/6q1/8/7k/4Q3/7P/2r2p1K/5R2 b - - 0 1". The 'b' in the notation indicates that it's Black's turn to move.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: The Black pieces are a queen (q), a king (k), and a rook (r), and a pawn (p).

3. **Locate Black's pieces**: 
   - The Black queen is on g7.
   - The Black king is on h5.
   - The Black rook is on c2.
   - The Black pawn is on f2.

4. **Consider the movement rules for each of Black's pieces and check for legality**:
   - The Black queen on g7 can move. It can potentially move to various squares along its rank, file, or diagonals, as long as it's not blocked or capturing one of its own pieces. It can capture the White queen on e4.
   - The Black king on h5 is somewhat restricted due to its position and the presence of the White queen. It needs to be cautious about moving into check.
   - The Black rook on c2 can move along the c-file or its current rank. However, its movement is somewhat restricted.
   - The Black pawn on f2 is blocked by the White king on g2 (if it were on g2, it would be blocked, but it's actually on h2, so the pawn can potentially move forward).

5. **Analyze potential moves**:
   - The Black queen can capture the White queen on e4. This is a valid move as it follows the movement rules for a queen. Qg7xe4 is a legal move.
   - Other potential moves for the Black queen, rook, and pawn should be considered, but given the presence of the White queen and the Black king's somewhat exposed position, capturing the White queen is a significant move.
   - The Black king's moves are limited due to the need to avoid check. It cannot move to h4 or h6 because of the White queen's influence (though h6 is not directly under attack, h4 would be into check from e4 or potentially other White pieces if they were nearby).
   - The Black rook can potentially move, but its best move isn't immediately obvious without checking all possibilities.
   - The Black pawn on f2 could potentially move to f1, promoting to a queen, but it's currently blocked by the White king being on h2, not g2, so it actually can move forward.

6. **Check for checks and captures**: 
   - Capturing the White queen is a high-priority move because it removes a significant piece from the board and could potentially change the dynamics of the game.

7. **Select a legal move**: 
   - Qxe4 is a legal and significant move as it captures the White queen.

Let's format this into the required output.
