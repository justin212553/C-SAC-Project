To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: `8/8/8/8/8/6B1/5QN1/5K1k w - - 0 1`.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The position indicates that it's White's turn to move because the side to move is specified by the letter 'w' in the FEN string.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: From the FEN, we can see that White has a King (K) on f1, a Queen (Q) on f2, a Knight (N) on g2, and a Bishop (B) on g3.

3. **Consider the movement rules for each of White's pieces**:
   - The King (K) on f1 can move to e1, e2, or g1, or potentially capture on g2, but it's restricted by the presence of other White pieces and the need to avoid check.
   - The Queen (Q) on f2 has a wide range of potential moves along the f-file, the second rank, and diagonals.
   - The Knight (N) on g2 can potentially move to e1, e3, f4, or h4.
   - The Bishop (B) on g3 can move along the diagonals it's on.

4. **Assess the position and check for legal moves**:
   - The Black King is on h1, which is under attack by the White Queen on f2. The Queen is already in a position to potentially deliver checkmate or put the Black King in check.
   - Checking the Queen's move: `Qxf1#` is checkmate as it captures the Black King (though the Black King is not actually on f1, this is a thought process; the actual checkmate is not available directly).
   - A simpler checkmate is available: The White Queen can move to `h4` (Qh4#) or more directly `Qg1#` or `Qh2#` are not available due to the Black King's position being on h1, but `Qf1#` is not possible as the King is on f1. However, `Qg1#` is a valid checkmate.

5. **Check if `Qg1#` follows the rules**:
   - It's a Queen move.
   - The Queen can move to g1.
   - It doesn't leave the White King in check.
   - It's not moving onto a square occupied by another White piece.

6. **Output the chosen move in the required format**:
Since the task is to output a single legal move and we've identified a checkmate, we can directly output that.
