To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string "5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1" indicates that it's Black's turn to move because the second field is "b", which stands for Black.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: Looking at the FEN, Black's pieces are:
   - King (k) on f8
   - Queen (q) on f7
   - Knight (n) on g7
   - Bishop (b) on g6

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**:
   - The King (f8) can potentially move to e8 or e7, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - The Queen (f7) can move along ranks, files, or diagonals. Potential moves include along the f-file or to other squares on the 7th rank or diagonally.
   - The Knight (g7) can potentially move to f5, h5, or e6, e8, depending on its movement rules.
   - The Bishop (g6) can move diagonally.

4. **Check for legality of potential moves**:
   - For the King (f8), moving to e8 is a potential move as it doesn't seem to put the King in check or move onto a square occupied by another Black piece. Moving to e7 is also possible.
   - For the Queen (f7), it can potentially move to other squares on the f-file or the 7th rank. However, we need to check for legality.
   - The Knight (g7) has potential moves, but we need to verify if they are legal.
   - The Bishop (g6) can potentially move along the diagonals it's on.

5. **Detailed check for a few candidate moves**:
   - Checking the King: Moving to e8 is legal as it doesn't put the King in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece.
   - Checking the Queen: The Queen can move to f8, but that's onto the King, so it's not a valid move. It can move along the 7th rank or the f-file. Qf8 is not valid, but Qe7 or Qe8 could be if not for the fact that Qf8 is the only move along the f-file towards the King and it's blocked by the King. However, moving to other squares like d5 or c4 or along the diagonal is possible if not blocked or putting the King in check.
   - Checking the Knight: The Knight can potentially move to e8 or f5. e8 is a valid move as it doesn't put the King in check or occupy the same square as another Black piece.

6. **Pick a legal move**:
   - One simple and legal move is to move the King from f8 to e8. This is a straightforward move that follows the King's movement rules and doesn't leave the King in check or on a square occupied by another Black piece.

Let's output the chosen move in the required format.
