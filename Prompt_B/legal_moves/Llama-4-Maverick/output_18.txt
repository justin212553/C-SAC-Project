To determine the side to move, we look at the given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string: `3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3nP3/2QPqP2/PP3B1P/3R1R1K b - - 0 1`. The 'b' in the string indicates it's Black's turn to move.

Now, let's analyze the position:

1. **Determine the side to move:** It's Black's turn.

2. **Identify Black's pieces:** Black has a king on g8, a rook on f8, a rook on d8, a knight on d4, pawns on e3 (which is attacked), and pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7, h7.

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move:**
   - The Black king is somewhat safe on g8 but needs to be cautious about potential checks.
   - The rook on d8 is somewhat tied down due to the potential pin on the king, but it can move along the d-file.
   - The rook on f8 can potentially move, but its mobility is limited due to the presence of the other Black rook and the king.
   - The knight on d4 is under some pressure but has potential moves.
   - The pawn on e3 is under attack and needs to be considered for capture or defense.

4. **Analyze potential moves:**
   - **Moving the knight:** The knight on d4 can potentially move to b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f3, or f5. Let's check a few: `Nd4-b5`, `Nd4-c2`, `Nd4-f3`, `Nd4-f5`, and `Nd4-e2` or `Nd4-e6` are potential moves. `Nd4-c2` and `Nd4-e2` could potentially fork the White rooks, but we need to check if they are legal.
   - **Other pieces:** The Black rooks and pawns have limited mobility or are pinned. The pawn on e3 is a candidate for capture or escape.

5. **Checking legality of a few candidate moves:**
   - `Nd4-c2` is a potential move as it develops the knight and could potentially attack the White rooks. However, we need to check if it's legal.
   - `Qe3-f2+` is a check, and since the queen is already on e3, we should verify if it's a valid move. The queen can move to f2, putting the White king in check, and it's a relatively safe move.

6. **Verifying the legality of `Qe3-f2+`:**
   - The queen is on e3, and f2 is a valid destination according to the queen's movement rules.
   - It doesn't leave the Black king in check.
   - It doesn't move onto a square occupied by another Black piece.

7. **Choosing a move:** `Qe3-f2+` is a strong candidate as it puts the White king in check and is a relatively safe move.

Let's format the chosen move according to the instructions.
