To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: bn2k3/2R2r2/1p1p4/3N2BB/4P3/2P3PP/r4r2/R3n2K w - - 0 1

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because the side to move is denoted by 'w' (for White) or 'b' (for Black), and here it's 'w'.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: White has a Rook on c7, a Knight on d5, two Bishops on d5 and g5 (though one of these is actually on h5, assuming standard FEN notation), a Pawn on e4, c3, g3, and h3, and another Rook on a1, and a King on h1, and a Knight on e1.

3. **Correcting the understanding of the position**: Let's decode the FEN correctly:
   - bn2k3: Black has a Bishop on b8, a Knight on c8, and a King on e8.
   - 2R2r2: White has a Rook on c7, and Black has a Rook on f7.
   - 1p1p4: Black has Pawns on b6 and d6.
   - 3N2BB: White has a Knight on d5, and Bishops on f5 and g5 (or h5, correctly placed).
   - 4P3: White has a Pawn on e4.
   - 2P3PP: White has Pawns on c3, g3, and h3 (or g3 and h3, with the third Pawn being on a different file, correctly on e4, c3, and h3/g3).
   - r4r2: Black has Rooks on a8 and f2.
   - R3n2K: White has a Rook on a1, a Knight on e1, and a King on h1.

4. **Analyzing White's possible moves**:
   - The White King is on h1. It is not in check. Possible moves could be Kg2, but we need to check if it's safe and legal.
   - The White Rook on c7 is attacking the Black Rook on f7. It can potentially move along the 7th rank or along the c-file.
   - The White Knight on d5 is well-placed and can potentially move to other squares like b4, b6, c3, e3, e7, or f4, f6.
   - The White Bishops are on f5 and g5. The Bishop on f5 can move along the diagonal, and the one on g5 can potentially move to other squares on the diagonal or capture a piece if available.
   - The White Knight on e1 can move.

5. **Checking for legal moves**:
   - One immediate check is to see if there's a checkmate or a significant capture. 
   - The Black King is on e8 and is somewhat exposed. 
   - The White Rook on c7 is already putting pressure on f7.

6. **Selecting a move**:
   - Let's examine a potential checkmate or a strong move. 
   - The White Rook on c7 can potentially capture the Black Rook on f7, which is a straightforward and strong move as it captures an opponent's piece.

7. **Checking the legality of Rxc7 Rf7 capture**: The move involves RxR (Rook captures Rook). Specifically, Rxf7.

Let's verify if Rxf7 is a valid move:
- It follows the Rook's movement rules (along a file or rank).
- It doesn't leave the White King in check.
- It captures an opponent's piece.

Thus, Rxf7 is a valid and strong move.

The move in PGN notation is: 1. Rxf7
