To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r4r1k/p5Rp/1p3pb1/2P4N/2B5/P7/6PP/B2n1K1 w - - 0 1.

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because it has 'w' in the position where it specifies whose turn it is.

2. **Assess the position**: The position is r4r1k/p5Rp/1p3pb1/2P4N/2B5/P7/6PP/B2n2K1. Let's decode it:
   - **r4r1k**: Black's Rook, empty, empty, empty, Rook, empty, King.
   - **p5Rp**: Black's Pawn, empty, empty, empty, empty, White's Rook, Black's Pawn.
   - **1p3pb1**: empty, Black's Pawn, empty, empty, empty, Black's Pawn, White's Bishop, empty.
   - **2P4N**: empty, White's Pawn, empty, empty, empty, empty, White's Knight.
   - **2B5**: empty, empty, White's Bishop, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty.
   - **P7**: White's Pawn, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty.
   - **6PP**: empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, White's Pawn, White's Pawn.
   - **B2n2K1**: White's Bishop, empty, empty, White's Knight, empty, empty, White's King, empty.

3. **Understanding the Position**: White is to move. The White King is on f1, and it's not in check. There are several White pieces on the board: a Rook on g7 (potentially pinning a Black piece or putting pressure on Black's position), a Knight on h5, a Bishop on c4, a Pawn on c5 (which could be a passed pawn or supported by other Pawns or pieces), a Pawn on a3, and Pawns on g2 and h2. There's also a White Bishop on a1 and a White King on f1.

4. **Checking Possible Moves**:
   - The White Rook on g7 is attacking the Black Pawn on g6 and is somewhat entrenched. It can potentially move along the g-file or capture the Black Pawn on g6.
   - The White Knight on h5 can move to f6 or g3, among other potential moves.
   - The White Bishop on c4 can potentially move to other squares on the diagonal or capture a piece if available.
   - The White Pawn on c5 is somewhat advanced and could potentially be used to capture or push forward.

5. **Evaluating Candidate Moves**:
   - **Rxg6+**: This is a potential check, capturing the Black Pawn. It follows the Rook's movement rules and puts the Black King in check. Let's verify if it's legal.
   - The Black King is on h8, and the Rook on g7 can capture the Pawn on g6, putting the Black King in check. The move **Rxg6+** is a valid move as it follows the Rook's movement, doesn't leave the White King in check, and captures an opponent's Pawn.

6. **Choosing a Move**: **Rxg6+** is a strong candidate as it is a check and captures a Pawn. Let's verify if the Black King can escape the check or capture the Rook. The Black King can move to h7, but then it would be in an uncomfortable position or potentially still in check from other pieces. The move is a good candidate.

7. **Outputting the Move**: The chosen move is **1. Rxg6+**.
