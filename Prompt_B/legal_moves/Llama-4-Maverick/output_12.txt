To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format (4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1), let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given ends with "b - - 0 1", indicating that Black is to move because 'b' denotes Black's turn.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: From the FEN, we can decode the position:
   - The board is represented row by row from the 8th to the 1st row.
   - "4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R" translates to:
     - 8th row: Empty, Empty, Empty, White Bishop, Empty, Black Knight, White King, Empty
     - 7th row: Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, White Rook
     - 6th row: White Rook, Empty, Empty, Empty, Black Rook, Empty, Empty
     - 5th row: Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty
     - 4th row: Empty, Empty, Empty, Black Bishop, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty
     - 3rd row: Empty, Empty, Black King, Black Queen, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty
     - 2nd row: Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty
     - 1st row: Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty, White Rook
   - So, Black's pieces are: Knight (on g8), Rook (on e6), Bishop (on d4), King (on c3), Queen (on d3).

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**:
   - The Black Knight on g8 can potentially move.
   - The Black Rook on e6 can potentially move.
   - The Black Bishop on d4 can potentially move.
   - The Black King on c3 is in a position to potentially move but is restricted due to being in check or potentially moving into check.
   - The Black Queen on d3 can potentially move.

4. **Check potential moves for legality**:
   - **Black King (c3)**: The King is under attack (as it's on c3 and potentially in check from the White Rook on h1 or other pieces). It needs to move to a safe square. Potential moves include b2, b3, b4, c2, c4, d2, d3, d4. However, d3 is occupied by the Black Queen, and other moves need to be checked for check.
   - **Black Queen (d3)**: The Queen is on d3 and can move. However, it's blocked by the King on c3. It can potentially capture the White Rook on h7 or other White pieces if not blocked or if it's a valid capture.
   - **Other pieces**: The Black Rook on e6 and Bishop on d4 have potential moves.

Let's directly assess the position:
- The Black King is on c3, and it's actually in check from the White Rook on h1. The King is in check and must move or be shielded.
- The White Rook on h1 is giving check. The Black King can move away or interpose a piece.

Given the check, the priority is to address it. The Black King can move to b2, b3, c2, or d2 to get out of check. 

Let's check a few candidate moves:
- **Kd2**: This move interposes the King and is a valid move to get out of check. The Queen on d3 can potentially capture the Rook on h7, but first, the King must be safe.

Let's directly check the move **1... Kd2**.

The move is in PGN format and includes the move number for Black.
