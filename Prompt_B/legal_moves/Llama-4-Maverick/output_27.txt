To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 5r2/2R2P1k/7p/4q3/7K/8/6Q1/8 w - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given ends with "w - - 0 1", where "w" indicates that White is to move.

2. **Identify White's pieces and potential moves**: The White pieces on the board are a Rook on c7, a Pawn on f7, a Queen on g2, and a King on h4.

3. **Consider the movement rules and check for legality**:
   - The White Rook on c7 can move along the 7th rank or the c-file, but it is restricted by the presence of other pieces and the need to not put the White King in check. It can potentially capture the Black Rook on f8.
   - The White Pawn on f7 is on the 7th rank and can potentially promote. It can capture the Black Queen on e5 if it were on e5 (but it's on e8 if we consider the Black Queen's actual position, e5, and there's no Black piece on f8 to be captured by the Pawn directly). However, it can move forward to f8, potentially promoting.
   - The White Queen on g2 has various potential moves but is restricted by the need to keep the Black Queen and Rook in check or at least not to put the White King in a vulnerable position.
   - The White King on h4 is somewhat restricted due to the need to avoid check from the Black Queen.

4. **Analyze potential moves**:
   - The Rook on c7 can capture the Black Rook on f8: c7xf8 (Rxr8 is not possible directly, but c7xf8=R or other promotion is a valid move).
   - The Pawn on f7 can promote by moving to f8. Since it's on f7, it can move to f8 and promote to any piece (except a King). So, f7f8=Q (or R, B, N) is a valid move.
   - Checking the legality of these moves:
     - For c7xf8, it's a valid capture and doesn't put the White King in check.
     - For f7f8, promoting to a Queen (Q) is a valid and strong choice.

5. **Select a legal move**: 
   - One of the simplest and most straightforward legal moves is to promote the Pawn on f7. So, f7f8=Q is a valid move.

Let's format this as per the required output.
