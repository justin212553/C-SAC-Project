To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 6kn/5p1p/6p1/2B1P3/1P2P3/5P2/2r3PP/R5K1 w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because it says "w" before the last two fields.

2. **Assess the position**: The position is 6kn/5p1p/6p1/2B1P3/1P2P3/5P2/2r3PP/R5K1. Let's decode it:
   - The White King is on g1, and it's not in check.
   - White has a Bishop on c5, a pawn on b4, pawns on e5, e4, and f3, and a pawn on g2, and a Rook on a1.
   - Black has a King on h8, a Knight on g8, pawns on f7, g6, h7, and a Rook on c2.

3. **Consider White's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The White King (Kg1) can potentially move to f2 or h2, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - The White Bishop (Bc5) can potentially move along its diagonals.
   - The White Rook (Ra1) can move along the first rank or the 'a' file.
   - White pawns have limited mobility due to their positions and the presence of other pieces.

4. **Checking potential moves**:
   - **Kg1-f2 or Kg1-h2**: Moving the King to f2 or h2 would be a valid move if it doesn't put the King in check. Since there's no immediate check on g1 and f2 is somewhat safer than h2 due to the presence of the Black Rook on c2, Kg1-f2 is a potential move.
   - **Bc5 moving**: The Bishop can move along the diagonals it's on. Potential moves include Be3 (if not blocked or capturing), Bf8+, or other diagonal moves. Bf8+ is an interesting move as it checks the Black King.
   - **Ra1 moving**: The Rook can potentially move to any square on the 'a' file or along the first rank. However, most of its potential moves are blocked by other White pieces or are not immediately useful.

5. **Checking legality and picking a move**:
   - Let's examine **Bf8+**: It's a valid move according to the Bishop's movement rules. It doesn't leave the White King in check, and it's not moving to a square occupied by another White piece. It puts the Black King in check, which is a good aggressive move.
   - **Kg1-f2** is also a valid move as it doesn't put the King in check and is a safe move.

6. **Choosing a move**: Between the considered moves, **1. Bf8+** is a strong candidate because it's an aggressive move that puts the Black King in check. It's a straightforward and effective move.
