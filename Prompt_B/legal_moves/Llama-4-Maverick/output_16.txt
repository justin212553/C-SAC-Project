To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 3k4/7p/pp1P1rp1/4K3/7r/1P1N1b2/P7/R3R3 b - - 0 1, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given ends with "b - - 0 1", indicating that Black is to move because 'b' denotes Black's turn.

2. **Identify Black's pieces on the board**: From the FEN, we can see the Black pieces are: k (king on d8), p (pawns on b6, a7, h7), r (rooks on g6, h4), and b (bishop on f3).

3. **Consider which of Black's pieces can move**: 
   - The king (k) on d8 can potentially move to c8, c7, or d7, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - The pawns are somewhat restricted; a7 and h7 can potentially move forward one square, and b6 can capture diagonally if there's an opponent piece.
   - The rooks on g6 and h4 can potentially move along the ranks or files they are on.
   - The bishop on f3 can potentially move along the diagonals it's on.

4. **Check potential moves for legality**:
   - For the king on d8, moving to c8 or d7 would be putting it on a relatively safer square, but we need to check for checks and if the squares are occupied by other Black pieces or not. c7 is occupied by a White pawn (d6), so that's not an option.
   - The pawns on a7 and h7 can move forward. a7 can move to a6 (since it's not blocked), and h7 can move to h6 (since it's not blocked).
   - The rook on g6 can potentially move along the g-file or the 6th rank. It can capture the White pawn on d6.
   - The rook on h4 can move along the h-file or the 4th rank.
   - The bishop on f3 is somewhat restricted due to the presence of other pieces and its own movement capabilities.

5. **Mentally check a few candidate moves**:
   - **Rxd6**: The rook on g6 can capture the pawn on d6. This is a significant capture as it removes a White pawn and potentially opens up the position.
   - **h5**: The pawn on h7 can move to h5, advancing it.
   - **Kd7**: The king moving to d7 is another possibility if it's legal.

Let's check the legality of **Rxd6**: The rook on g6 can capture the pawn on d6. The move follows the rook's movement rules (it can move horizontally or vertically), it doesn't leave the Black king in check (since the White king is far and there's no other piece directly checking), and d6 is occupied by a White pawn, not a Black piece.

**Rxd6** seems like a strong candidate as it captures a pawn and is a straightforward, legal move.

Let's verify if **Rxd6** is indeed a valid move in the given position:
- The White pawn is on d6.
- The Black rook on g6 can capture it.

Thus, **1... Rxd6** is a valid and strong move.
