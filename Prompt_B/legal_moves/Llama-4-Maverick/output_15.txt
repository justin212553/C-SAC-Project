To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: r3r3/p7/1p1n1B2/7R/4k3/PP1p1RP1/7P/3K4 w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because it says "w" before the last two fields.

2. **Understand the position**: The position is: 
   - White: King on d1, Pawns on a2, b2, h2, Rooks on g3, h5, Bishop on f6.
   - Black: King on e4, Pawns on b6, d3, Rooks on e8, d8, Knight on d6.

3. **Analyze White's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The White King is on d1. It can potentially move to c1, c2, d2, or e1, but we need to check for legality.
   - The White Pawns are on a2, b2, and h2. a2 and b2 can potentially move forward one or two squares, and h2 can move forward one or two squares as well.
   - The White Rooks are on g3 and h5. The Rook on g3 can move along the g-file or on the third rank. The Rook on h5 can move along the h-file or on the fifth rank.
   - The White Bishop is on f6. It is somewhat restricted but can potentially move along its diagonals.

4. **Checking for potential moves**:
   - The White King cannot move to c2 because d3 is under attack by the White Bishop indirectly, but more directly, the King cannot move into a potentially contested square without checking. It can move to c1 or e1. Let's check if these moves are safe.
   - The Pawns on a2 and b2 can move forward. a2 to a3 or a4 is possible, and b2 to b3 or b4 is possible. h2 can move to h3 or h4.
   - The Rook on g3 can potentially move along the g-file or the third rank. It can capture the Black Knight on d6 if it were on d3, but it's not. However, it can potentially move to e3, f3, or other places on the third rank.
   - The Rook on h5 is somewhat restricted due to its position but can potentially move along the h-file or the fifth rank.

5. **Checking legality and selecting a move**:
   - Let's start with the Rook on g3. It can move to e3, putting it on the third rank and potentially putting pressure on Black's position. The move Rge3# is checkmate if Black's King were on a different square or if other pieces were positioned differently, but here it's a potential strong move. Rge3 is a valid move as it follows the Rook's movement rules and doesn't put the White King in check or on a square occupied by another White piece.

6. **Checking if Rge3 is a valid and good choice**:
   - The Black King is on e4. Rge3 is a check because the Rook on e3 is attacking the Black King. This is a significant move as it puts the Black King in check.

Let's verify if the Black King can escape the check or capture the checking Rook:
- The Black King can try to move to d4, d5, f4, f5, e5, or other adjacent squares, but it is somewhat restricted.
- Upon closer inspection, moving the Black King to f5 or d5 would still be in check from the Rook on h5 if it were on the fifth rank, but here it's more about the Rook on e3. The King can't capture the Rook on e3 because it's supported (though in this case, it's not directly supported, it's still a check).

7. **Conclusion**: The move Rge3+ is a check. Let's verify the exact move in PGN format.

1. Rge3+ is the chosen move.
