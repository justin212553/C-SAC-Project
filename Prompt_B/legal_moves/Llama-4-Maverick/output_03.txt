To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN notation given is "6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1". The 'w' in the notation indicates that it is White's turn to move.

2. **Identify the pieces of the side to move**: White has a King on b4 and a Rook on e5. 

3. **Consider the possible moves for White's pieces**:
   - The White King on b4 can potentially move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) one square, provided the destination square is not occupied by another White piece and is not under attack by a Black piece. The King is currently on b4, so it can potentially move to a3, a4, a5, b3, b5, c3, c4, or c5. However, we need to check if any of these moves are valid by ensuring the King doesn't move into check or onto a square occupied by another White piece.
   - The White Rook on e5 can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares, provided there are no other pieces in the way. The Rook can potentially move along the e-file or along the 5th rank. So, it can move to e1, e2, e3, e4, e6, e7, e8, or to d5, c5, b5, a5.

4. **Check for validity and potential moves**:
   - For the White King, we need to check if any of its potential moves are valid. The Black King is on g8, which is far from b4, so the White King is not under immediate threat and can move to any adjacent square that isn't occupied by another White piece. The squares a3, a4, a5, b3, b5, c3, c4, and c5 are potential targets. a5 is a valid move as it is not occupied by a White piece and is safe.
   - For the White Rook, since there are no other White pieces on the board, the Rook's movement is only restricted by its potential to capture Black pieces or move to empty squares along its valid paths. One valid move could be to check or threaten the Black King. The Rook can potentially move to e8 to put the Black King in check.

5. **Select a legal move**:
   - A simple and effective move for White is to play the Rook to e8, putting the Black King in check. This is a valid and potentially advantageous move.

Let's format this move in PGN notation. The current move is White's first move, so the move number is 1. The move is "Re8+".
