To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: r1bk3r/pppq1ppp/5n2/4N1N1/2Bp4/Bn6/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 1, let's break down the process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string indicates that it's White's turn to move because it contains 'w' before the last two fields that denote the castling rights and the en passant square.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: White has a King (K), a Queen (Q) is not present, a Rook (R), two Knights (N), a Bishop (B), and Pawns (P).

3. **Locate White's pieces and consider their possible moves**:
   - The White King is on g1.
   - The White Rook is on e1.
   - One White Knight is on e5, and the other is on g5.
   - The White Bishop is on c4.
   - The White pieces on the board also include a Bishop on a3 and Pawns on a2, f2, g2, and h2.

4. **Check for potential moves**:
   - The King on g1 can potentially move to h1 or h2, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - The Rook on e1 can move along the e-file or along the first rank, but its movement is restricted by the King on g1.
   - The Knights on e5 and g5 can potentially jump to various squares.
   - The Bishop on c4 can potentially move along its diagonals.
   - The Bishop on a3 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move along its diagonals.
   - The Pawns have limited mobility, mostly forward, with some having the option to move two squares forward if they are on their starting rank.

5. **Analyze the position and check for legality**:
   - The White King is somewhat exposed but not directly in check. Moving it to h1 or h2 doesn't put it in check either.
   - The Rook on e1 is somewhat pinned because of the Black King on d8, but it's not a straightforward pin since there are pieces between them.
   - The Knights can potentially jump to safe squares. For example, Ne5-g4 or Ng5-f3 could be considered if they were not putting the King in danger or if they were capturing an opponent's piece.
   - The Bishop on c4 is somewhat restricted due to the presence of other pieces on the board.

6. **Consider a few candidate moves and check their legality**:
   - One potential move is to move the Rook on e1. However, we need to check if there's a safe and legal destination.
   - Another potential move involves the Knights. The Knight on g5 can potentially move to f3, which is a legal move as it doesn't put the White King in check and is not blocked by other White pieces.

7. **Pick a legal move**: Let's examine moving the Knight on g5 to f3. This move is legal as it follows the Knight's movement rules, doesn't leave the White King in check, and doesn't move onto a square occupied by another White piece.

The move is for White, and it's the first move, so the move number is 1.

The chosen move in PGN format is: 1. Nf3

[FINAL PGN]
1. Ngf3
