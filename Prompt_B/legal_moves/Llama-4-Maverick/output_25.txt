To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: `2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1`.

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN notation indicates that it's White's turn to move because the letter 'w' is specified before the last two fields (`0 1`), which denote the halfmove clock and the fullmove number, respectively.

2. **Assess the position**: 
   - The White king is on a4, and it's not in check.
   - White has a rook on c8, a queen on f6, a bishop on f5, and a pawn on e5.
   - Black has a king on a8, a pawn on b7, a rook on f7, a queen on h7, and a bishop on f2.

3. **Consider White's pieces and potential moves**:
   - The White rook on c8 can potentially move along the c-file or along the 8th rank.
   - The White queen on f6 is somewhat restricted due to the presence of the Black rook on f7 and other Black pieces, but it can potentially move.
   - The White bishop on f5 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move to certain squares.
   - The White pawn on e5 is blocked by a potential capture but is not moving on its own without capturing.

4. **Checking potential moves**:
   - The White king (a4) can move to b4 or b3 or a3 since a5 is occupied by a White pawn and moving to a5 would put it on the same square as its own pawn, which is not a valid move anyway.
   - Let's check if the White king is safe to move: Moving to b4 or b3 would put it in a relatively safer position or at least not directly in check. For example, `1. Ka4-b3` is a potential move.

5. **Checking other White pieces**:
   - The White queen (f6) can capture the Black rook on f7. This is a valid move as it follows the queen's movement rules and captures an opponent's piece. So, `1. Qxf7` is a valid move.

6. **Selecting a move**:
   - `1. Qxf7` is a valid and strong move as it captures a Black rook.
   - Let's verify if it leaves the White king in check or not. After `1. Qxf7`, Black can respond with `1... Qxf7`, but White's king is still relatively safe on a4.

7. **Output the chosen move in the required format**:
   - The move `1. Qxf7` is chosen.
