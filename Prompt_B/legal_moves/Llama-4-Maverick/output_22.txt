To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 1k6/1p6/5r2/3q2p1/Qp1P4/4PrPp/2R4P/R5K1 b - - 0 1, let's first understand the position.

1. **Side to Move**: The FEN format indicates the side to move by 'w' for White and 'b' for Black. Here, it's 'b', meaning it's Black's turn.

2. **Understanding the Position**: 
   - The Black king is on c8 (1k6).
   - Black has pawns on b7 (1p6) and g5, h3 (3q2p1 and 4PrPp).
   - Black has a queen on d5 (3q2p1) and rooks on f6 and f3 (5r2 and 4PrPp).
   - White has a queen on a4 (Qp1P4), pawns on d4 and g3 (Qp1P4 and 4PrPp), and h2 (2R4P).
   - White has rooks on c2 and a1 (2R4P and R5K1).
   - The White king is on g1 (R5K1).

3. **Analyzing Black's Pieces and Possible Moves**:
   - The Black king is somewhat safe on c8 but lacks mobility.
   - The Black queen on d5 is active and can potentially move.
   - The Black rooks are also active, with one on f6 and the other on f3, putting pressure on the f-file.
   - Black pawns are on b7, g5, and h3. The pawn on h3 is quite advanced and potentially weak.

4. **Checking Candidate Moves**:
   - **Qd5 moves**: The queen can move to various squares. Let's check if it can capture or move to a safe square. Qd5xa4 is a possible capture, taking the White queen.
   - **Rook moves**: The rooks can potentially move along the f-file or to other open files/ranks. However, we need to check for legality and potential threats.
   - **Pawn moves**: The pawns have limited mobility. The b7 pawn can potentially move to b6 or b5 if not capturing. The g5 pawn can potentially capture or move forward if safe.

5. **Selecting a Legal Move**:
   - **Qxa4** is a straightforward capture, taking White's queen. It follows the queen's movement rules, doesn't leave the Black king in check (since the White queen is captured), and doesn't move onto a square occupied by another Black piece.

6. **Outputting the Move**:
   - The move is for Black, and the current move number is 1. So, the move should be notated as "1...Qxa4".
