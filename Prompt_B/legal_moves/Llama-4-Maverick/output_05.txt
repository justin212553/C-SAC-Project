To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: 8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning process.

1. **Determine which side is to move**: The FEN string "8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1" indicates that White is to move because of the 'w' before the last two fields.

2. **Identify White's pieces on the board**: White has a King on a1, a Rook on h7, a Bishop on b4 (misinterpreted, it's actually on f4 if we correctly place the pieces according to the FEN), Pawns on b4, c4, and c5.

   Correcting the piece identification based on the FEN:
   - The 'K' on a1 is the White King.
   - The 'R' on h7 is the White Rook.
   - The 'B' is actually on f4 (not b4), indicating the White Bishop.
   - The 'P's on b4, c4, and c5 are White Pawns.

3. **Consider which of White's pieces can move**:
   - The White King on a1 can potentially move to a2 or b1 or b2, provided these moves are legal.
   - The White Rook on h7 can potentially move along the 7th rank or up/down on the h-file, provided the moves are legal.
   - The White Bishop on f4 can potentially move along its diagonals.
   - The White Pawns have limited mobility; the one on c5 can potentially move to c6.

4. **Check the legality of potential moves**:
   - For the White King (a1): Moving to a2 or b2 would put it into check or on a square occupied by another piece (in the case of b2, potentially illegal due to being in check or occupied). b1 is a potential square if not occupied or putting it in check.
   - For the White Rook (h7): It can potentially capture the Black King on a6 if it's a legal move (check if it's on the same rank or file and if there are intervening pieces).
   - For the White Bishop (f4): It can move along its diagonals. Potential moves include e3, d2, e5, g3, g5, h6.
   - For the White Pawns: The c5 Pawn can move to c6.

5. **Checking specific moves**:
   - The Black King is on a6. The White Rook on h7 can potentially check or capture it if on the same rank. The Rook can move to a7, putting the Black King in check or capturing it, which is a legal and significant move.

6. **Selecting a legal move**:
   - One straightforward legal move is for the Rook on h7 to move to a7, checking the Black King. This is a valid move as it follows the Rook's movement rules and does not leave the White King in check or move onto a square occupied by another White piece.

Let's verify:
- The White Rook on h7 can move to a7, putting the Black King on a6 in check. This is a valid and strong move.

The move is: 1. Ra7#
