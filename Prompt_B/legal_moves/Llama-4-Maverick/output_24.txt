To determine the legal move for the given position in FEN format: b2N2k1/6pp/p7/2b5/2p4n/1P3PB1/P5rP/R4R1K b - - 0 1, let's first understand the position.

1. **Side to Move**: The first step is to identify which side is to move. The FEN notation given ends with "b - - 0 1", where "b" indicates it's Black's turn.

2. **Understanding the Position**: The given FEN is b2N2k1/6pp/p7/2b5/2p4n/1P3PB1/P5rP/R4R1K. Let's decode it:
   - The position is: Black king on f8, White knight on d7, Black pawn on g7, Black pawn on h7, Black pawn on a6, White pawn on b3, White pawn on f3, White bishop on g3, White pawn on a2, White pawn on h2, White rook on f1, White king on h1, Black rook on g2, Black knight on h4, Black bishop on c5, Black pawn on c4.
   - Black is to move.

3. **Identifying Potential Moves**:
   - Black has several pieces on the board: a king, a queen is missing, a rook on g2, a knight on h4, a bishop on c5, and pawns on a6, c4, g7, and h7.
   - Let's consider the pieces that can potentially move: the king, the rook on g2, the knight on h4, the bishop on c5, and the pawns.

4. **Checking Potential Moves**:
   - **King (f8)**: Can move to e8 or e7 if not putting it in check. e7 is potentially under attack by the White Knight on d7, so that's not a safe move. Moving to e8 is a possibility.
   - **Rook (g2)**: Can potentially move along the g-file or to the second rank. It's already on g2, so it can potentially move to g1 or g3, or to f2, e2, or d2 if not blocked or capturing.
   - **Knight (h4)**: Can move to f5, g6, or f3. f3 is occupied by a White pawn, so that's not an option. g6 is a potential square.
   - **Bishop (c5)**: Can potentially move along the diagonals it's on. It can move to d4, e3, d6, e7, f8, b4, a3, or b6.
   - **Pawns**: a6 can move to a5. c4 can potentially capture b3. g7 can move to g6 or g5. h7 can move to h6 or h5.

5. **Checking for Legality**:
   - Let's check a few moves for legality:
     - **Kg8-e8**: This is a potential king move. The king is not moving into check.
     - **Rg2-g1+**: This would be a check, but it's worth checking if it's legal. The rook can move to g1, putting the White king in check. This is a valid move as it follows the rook's movement rules and doesn't leave the Black king in check (since it's the Black king making the move).
     - **Nh4-g6**: This is a valid knight move.
     - **Bc5-e3**: This captures a pawn and is a valid move.
     - **c4xb3**: This captures a pawn and is a valid move.

6. **Selecting a Move**:
   - Among the valid moves, **Rg2-g1+** is a check and a strong move as it directly attacks the White king. It's a simple and effective move.

Let's output the move in the required format.
