To determine the move to be played, let's first analyze the given FEN position: 1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1

1. **Identify the side to move**: The FEN string indicates that it's White's turn to move because it contains 'w' before the last two fields.

2. **Assess the position**: The position is complex, with several pieces on the board for both sides. White is to move.

3. **Identify White's pieces and potential moves**:
   - White's pieces: K (King on b8), R (Rook on d8), P (Pawns on b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7), N (Knight on b4 and d3), Q (Queen on d4).
   - The White King is on b8, which is somewhat exposed but currently not in check.

4. **Consider potential moves for White's pieces**:
   - The White Rook on d8 can potentially move along the d-file or to the right along the 8th rank, but its movement is restricted due to being pinned against the Black Rook on c1 and potentially other pieces.
   - White Pawns are mostly on the second rank and can potentially move forward one or two squares, but their movement is somewhat restricted.
   - The White Knights on b4 and d3 can potentially move to various squares, depending on their legal moves.
   - The White Queen on d4 has significant mobility.

5. **Check for immediate threats and potential moves**:
   - The Black King is on c2 and somewhat exposed. White's Queen is relatively close and could potentially create threats or capture Black pieces.
   - The White Queen can potentially capture the Black Queen on e3 or move to other squares, following standard Queen movements.

6. **Evaluate potential moves**:
   - One potential move is for the White Queen to capture the Black Queen on e3. This is a straightforward capture that follows the Queen's movement rules.
   - Checking if Qxe3 is legal: The Queen can move from d4 to e3, capturing the Black Queen. This does not put the White King in check, nor does it move onto a square occupied by another White piece.

7. **Select a legal move**: Qxe3 is a valid and reasonable move as it captures a significant piece (the Black Queen) without putting the White King in danger.

Let's format the move according to the instructions.

1. Qxe3 is the chosen move. In PGN format, considering it's White's first move, it should be represented as "1. Qxe3".
