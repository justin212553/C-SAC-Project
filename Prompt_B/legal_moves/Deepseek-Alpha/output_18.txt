1. Determine which side is to move:
   - The FEN indicates "b" (Black to move).

2. Identify Black's pieces and their potential moves:
   - Black has the following pieces:
     - Rooks on d8 and f8.
     - Knight on d4.
     - Queen on e3.
     - Pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7, h7.

3. Evaluate potential moves for each piece:
   - Rook on d8: Can move along the d-file or capture on d1.
   - Rook on f8: Can move along the f-file.
   - Knight on d4: Can jump to b3, c2, e2, f3, f5, e6, c6, or b5.
   - Queen on e3: Can move along ranks, files, or diagonals.
   - Pawns: Can advance one square forward (if not blocked) or capture diagonally.

4. Check legality of moves:
   - Ensure no move leaves the Black king in check.
   - Ensure moves follow the rules of chess.

5. Select one legal move:
   - A straightforward move is "Qxf3", where the Black queen captures the White pawn on f3.
