1. Determine which side is to move:
   - The FEN string ends with "b", indicating it is Black's turn to move.

2. Identify Black's pieces and their potential moves:
   - Black has the following pieces:
     - King on h8
     - Rook on c2
     - Bishop on g4
     - Bishop on h4
     - Knight on d4
   - Pawns on c6, h6, and e5

3. Evaluate potential moves for each piece:
   - King (h8): Can move to g8 or g7, but must avoid moving into check.
   - Rook (c2): Can move along the c-file or the 2nd rank, provided it does not land on a square occupied by a Black piece.
   - Bishop (g4): Can move diagonally, provided it does not land on a square occupied by a Black piece.
   - Bishop (h4): Can move diagonally, provided it does not land on a square occupied by a Black piece.
   - Knight (d4): Can jump to any of its valid knight moves, provided the destination square is not occupied by a Black piece.
   - Pawns: 
     - c6 pawn can move to c5.
     - h6 pawn can move to h5.
     - e5 pawn can move to e4.

4. Select one legal move:
   - After considering the above, I choose the move "h5" for the pawn on h6.
