1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w" (White to move).
2. Analyze White's pieces and their potential moves:
   - White has pawns on b4, e4, f3, g2, and h2.
   - White has a rook on a1, a bishop on c5, and a king on g1.
3. Consider legal moves for each piece:
   - The pawns can move forward if the squares are unoccupied or capture diagonally if an opponent's piece is present.
   - The rook can move horizontally or vertically, provided the path is clear.
   - The bishop can move diagonally, provided the path is clear.
   - The king can move one square in any direction, provided the square is not under attack.
4. Check for moves that do not leave the White king in check:
   - The Black rook on c2 and Black pawns do not currently threaten the White king directly.
5. Select one legal move:
   - Moving the pawn from b4 to b5 is a straightforward legal move. The square b5 is unoccupied, and the move does not leave the White king in check.
