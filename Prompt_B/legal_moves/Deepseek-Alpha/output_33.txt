--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w", meaning White is to move.
2. Consider which of White's pieces can move:
   - White has pawns on e4, c3, h3, g3, and h2.
   - White has rooks on a1 and c7.
   - White has bishops on g5 and h5.
   - White has a knight on d5.
   - White's king is on h1.
3. Evaluate candidate moves:
   - The knight on d5 can move to several squares: b6, c7, e7, f6, f4, e3, c3, and b4. These moves follow the knight's movement rules.
   - The rook on c7 can move along the 7th rank or the c-file. For example, Rc8 is a legal move.
   - The bishop on g5 can move diagonally to squares like h6, f6, e7, etc.
   - The bishop on h5 can move diagonally to squares like g6, f7, etc.
   - Pawns can move forward or capture, depending on their position.
   - The king on h1 can move to g1 or g2, but these squares are under attack by Black's rooks.
4. Ensure the move does not leave White's king in check:
   - Moves like Rc8 or Nd5-b6 do not expose the king to check.
5. Select one legal move: I choose Rc8, as it is a straightforward rook move that does not leave the king in check.
