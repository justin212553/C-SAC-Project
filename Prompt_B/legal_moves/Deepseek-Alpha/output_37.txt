1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w", meaning it is White's turn to move.
2. Consider which White pieces can move:
   - The White king on g1 can move to h1 or f1, but these squares must be checked for legality.
   - The White rook on e1 can move along the e-file or rank 1.
   - The White knight on e5 can move to various squares following its L-shaped movement pattern.
   - The White knight on g5 can also move to various squares following its L-shaped movement pattern.
   - The White bishop on c4 can move diagonally.
   - The White bishop on a3 can move diagonally.
   - The White pawns on a2, g2, and h2 can move forward or capture diagonally if possible.
3. Check legality of moves:
   - Ensure the move does not leave the White king in check.
   - Ensure the move does not land on a square occupied by another White piece.
4. Select one legal move: After considering the options, I will choose a move for the White knight on e5.
