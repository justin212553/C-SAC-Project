--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w", so it is White's turn to move.
2. Identify White's pieces and their potential moves:
   - White has a knight on e4, a rook on g4, and a king on g2.
   - The knight can move in an "L" shape to squares such as d6, f6, c5, c3, d2, f2, g3, or g5.
   - The rook can move horizontally or vertically to squares along the g-file or the 4th rank.
   - The king can move one square in any direction to f1, f2, f3, g1, h1, h2, or h3.
3. Check for legal moves:
   - The knight's moves must not land on squares occupied by White's own pieces or move out of bounds.
   - The rook's moves must not pass through or land on squares occupied by White's own pieces.
   - The king's moves must not place it in check.
4. Select one legal move:
   - After considering the above, I choose the move "Rg5" for the rook, which is a legal move.
