--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "b" (Black) is to move.
2. Identify Black's pieces and their potential moves:
   - Black has a king on g8, a bishop on c5, a knight on h4, and pawns on a6, c4, and g7. Additionally, there is a rook on g2.
3. Evaluate potential moves for each piece:
   - The king on g8 can move to h7 or h8, but not f7 or f8 (blocked by White's pieces).
   - The bishop on c5 can move diagonally to b4, d4, e3, or d6.
   - The knight on h4 can jump to f3, g2, or f5.
   - The rook on g2 can move along the g-file or capture on f1.
   - The pawns on a6, c4, and g7 can advance or capture if applicable.
4. Verify legality of moves:
   - Ensure no move leaves the Black king in check.
   - Ensure moves follow piece movement rules and do not land on squares occupied by Black's own pieces.
5. Select one legal move: I will choose a move for the rook on g2, as it has a strong attacking option.
