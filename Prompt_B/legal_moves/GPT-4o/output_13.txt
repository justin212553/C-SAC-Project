1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w", meaning White is to move.
2. Analyze White's pieces and their potential moves:
   - White has pawns on c6, d3, and f3.
   - White has rooks on f2 and e1.
   - White's king is on c7.
3. Consider legal moves for each piece:
   - The pawn on c6 can move to c7 (promotion) or capture b7.
   - The pawn on d3 can move to d4.
   - The pawn on f3 can move to f4.
   - The rook on f2 can move along the f-file or rank 2.
   - The rook on e1 can move along the e-file or rank 1.
   - The king on c7 can move to b7, b6, or d6.
4. Ensure the move does not leave the king in check or violate movement rules.
5. Select one legal move.
