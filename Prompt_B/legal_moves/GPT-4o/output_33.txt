--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move: The FEN indicates "w", meaning it is White's turn to move.
2. Consider which of White's pieces can move:
   - White has pawns on e4, c3, g3, h3.
   - White has rooks on a1 and c7.
   - White has bishops on g5 and h5.
   - White has a knight on d5.
   - White's king is on h1.
3. Evaluate candidate moves:
   - The knight on d5 can move to several squares (e7, f6, b6, c7, e3, f4, b4, c3).
   - The rook on c7 can move along the 7th rank or capture the black rook on f7.
   - The bishop on g5 can move to f6, h6, or capture the black rook on f7.
   - The bishop on h5 can move to g4, g6, or f7.
   - The pawns can advance or capture depending on their positions.
4. Verify legality:
   - Ensure the move does not leave White's king in check.
   - Ensure the move adheres to the rules of chess.
5. Choose one legal move: I will select a move for the rook on c7 to capture the black rook on f7.
