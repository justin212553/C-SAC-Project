--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move:
   - The FEN string ends with "w", indicating it is White's turn to move.

2. Consider which of White's pieces can move:
   - White has a king on a1, rooks on h7 and c4, pawns on c5 and b4, and a bishop on g4.
   - The king can move to b1 or b2.
   - The rook on h7 can move along the h-file or horizontally on the 7th rank.
   - The rook on c4 can move along the c-file or horizontally on the 4th rank.
   - The pawns on c5 and b4 can advance forward.
   - The bishop on g4 can move diagonally.

3. Check legality of candidate moves:
   - Ensure the move follows the piece's movement rules.
   - Ensure the move does not leave White's king in check.
   - Ensure the move does not land on a square occupied by White's own pieces.

4. Select one legal move:
   - A straightforward move is advancing the pawn on c5 to c6. This move is legal, follows the pawn's movement rules, and does not leave the king in check.
