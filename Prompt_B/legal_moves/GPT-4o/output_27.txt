--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move:
   - The FEN string ends with "w", indicating it is White's turn to move.

2. Identify White's pieces and their potential moves:
   - White has the following pieces: a king on h4, a queen on g2, and a rook on c7.
   - The king can move one square in any direction, provided it does not move into check or onto a square occupied by a White piece.
   - The queen can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, provided it does not move through or onto a square occupied by a White piece.
   - The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, provided it does not move through or onto a square occupied by a White piece.

3. Evaluate candidate moves:
   - The king on h4 has potential moves to g3, g4, g5, h3, and h5. However, some of these squares may be under attack or otherwise illegal.
   - The queen on g2 has many potential moves, including capturing Black's queen on e5 or moving to other squares along its lines of movement.
   - The rook on c7 can move along the 7th rank or the c-file. It can also deliver check by moving to c8.

4. Check legality of moves:
   - Moving the rook to c8 delivers check to the Black king on h7. This is a legal move and forces Black to respond to the check.

5. Select a move:
   - Among the legal moves, Rc8+ is a strong and forcing move. It is a check, and Black must respond.
