--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Determine which side is to move:
   - The FEN string ends with "w", indicating it is White's turn to move.

2. Consider which of White's pieces can move:
   - White has pawns on a2, g2, and h2.
   - White has knights on e5 and g5.
   - White has bishops on c4 and a3.
   - White has a rook on e1.
   - White's king is on g1.

3. Evaluate candidate moves:
   - The knight on e5 can move to several squares: f3, g4, g6, d3, d7, c6, and f7. These moves follow the knight's movement rules.
   - The knight on g5 can move to e4, e6, f3, h3, h7, and f7. These moves follow the knight's movement rules.
   - The bishop on c4 can move along diagonals to squares such as b3, d5, e6, f7, and others.
   - The bishop on a3 can move along diagonals to squares such as b4, c5, d6, e7, and others.
   - The rook on e1 can move vertically or horizontally to squares such as e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, d1, c1, b1, and a1.
   - The pawns on a2, g2, and h2 can move forward one square (a3, g3, h3) or two squares (a4, g4, h4) if unobstructed.

4. Check legality of moves:
   - Ensure the move does not leave White's king in check.
   - Ensure the move does not land on a square occupied by another White piece.

5. Select one legal move:
   - I choose the move "Nf7+" (knight from e5 to f7), which is a check to Black's king on d8.
