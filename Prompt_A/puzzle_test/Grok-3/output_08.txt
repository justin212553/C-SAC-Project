--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

The position is given by the FEN: 8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1, and the task is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move for Black. Since it's Black's turn to move and the goal is mate in 1, I need to identify a single move by Black that immediately delivers checkmate to the White king.

First, let's visualize the board based on the FEN:
- Black king on g7.
- Black knight on e5.
- Black rook on g5.
- White king on h1.
- White rook on f1.
- White rook on h1 (noting that h1 is occupied by the White king, so this seems to be a typo in my initial reading; correcting based on FEN, the second rook is on g1 as per "5RKR").
- White pawns on f2, g2, h2.

Correcting my interpretation: The FEN "5RKR" on the first rank means White rook on f1, White king on g1, White rook on h1. So:
- White king on g1.
- White rooks on f1 and h1.
- White pawns on f2, g2, h2.
- Black king on g7.
- Black knight on e5.
- Black rook on g5.

Now, Black needs to deliver checkmate in one move. Checkmate means the White king is in check and has no legal moves to escape the check (no way to move the king, block the check, or capture the checking piece).

Let's evaluate Black's pieces and their potential to deliver check:
1. **Black Rook on g5**: It's on the g-file, directly above the White king on g1. Moving the rook to g1 would be Rook to g1 (Rg1), but g1 is occupied by the White king, so that's not a legal move. However, the rook on g5 is already attacking down the g-file. If the White king is on g1, the rook on g5 is giving check right now because there are no pieces between g5 and g1 on the g-file. But the FEN indicates it's Black's turn, so if the White king is already in check, that would be inconsistent unless I misread something. Let's double-check: in chess, a position where a king is in check and it's the opponent's turn is legal if the check can be resolved, but here the goal is mate in 1, so I need to deliver a new check or ensure the current situation leads to mate.

Upon re-evaluating, I see my mistake. The White king is on g1, Black rook on g5, so yes, the White king is already under check from the rook on g5 because the g-file is open. However, since it's Black's turn and the problem is mate in 1, I must find a move that delivers mate immediately, not relying on the current check (as the current check might imply White's turn if it were a real game, but in puzzles, we follow the FEN's turn indicator). In puzzles, the turn is as specified, so Black moves next.

If the White king is on g1 and Black rook on g5, White is in check already, so Black moving would be after White's response, but the puzzle states mate in 1 with Black to move. I may have misread the FEN or the goal. Let's confirm the FEN: 8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1. Yes, White king on g1, Black rook on g5, so White is in check. But since it's Black's turn per FEN, and mate in 1, I need a move by Black that ensures mate regardless of the current check situation.

I think the intent is that Black delivers a new checking move that results in mate. Let's try possible moves:
- **Black Knight on e5**: Possible moves are to d7, f7, g6, g4, f3, d3, c4, c6. Let's see if any of these attack the White king on g1 and prevent escape.
  - Knight to f3 (Nf3): Attacks g1 (knight check on king). Now, check if White king can escape:
    - King to f1: Blocked by White rook on f1.
    - King to h1: Blocked by White rook on h1.
    - King to h2: Blocked by White pawn on h2.
    - King to f2: Blocked by White pawn on f2.
    - King to g2: Blocked by White pawn on g2.
    - No other squares (e.g., h3, g3, f3) are accessible due to knight on f3 and pawns/edge of board.
    - Can White block the check? No, knight checks can't be blocked.
    - Can White capture the knight? White rook on f1 can't move to f3 (blocked by pawn on f2), rook on h1 can't reach f3, king can't capture, no other pieces. So, knight to f3 is checkmate.

I initially thought the rook on g5 already checks the king, but in standard chess, if Black moves the knight to f3, it's a discovered check or additional check. Let's clarify: Black rook on g5 checks White king on g1 already. If Black moves knight to f3, it's a double check (rook and knight both checking the king). In double check, the king must move, as blocking or capturing one doesn't stop the other check.

So, with knight to f3:
- White king on g1 is checked by rook on g5 and knight on f3.
- King must move, but all adjacent squares are blocked:
  - f1: White rook.
  - h1: White rook.
  - f2, g2, h2: White pawns.
  - No other squares available.
- Thus, no escape, it's checkmate.

This seems correct. Let's confirm no other moves work as efficiently:
- Black rook moves (e.g., Rg3): Still checks, but White can move king if not double-checked, but since knight isn't involved, it's not immediate mate as White might have responses. However, king can't move anyway due to blocked squares, but problem specifies mate in 1, and knight move is clearer.
- Black king moves: Doesn't deliver check.
- Other knight moves like Ng6, Ng4 don't check the king directly in a mating way.

So, the move is knight to f3, delivering double check and mate since the king can't move.

I note that even without the knight move, the rook on g5 checks the king, and king can't move, so isn't it already mate? No: in chess, if it's Black's turn and White is in check, White would have to move out of check, but since it's a puzzle with Black to move and mate in 1, the intent must be Black makes a move to ensure mate. If White king can't move even now, it's stalemate or mate, but per rules, if king is in check and can't move, it's mate, but FEN says Black to move, so perhaps I misunderstood.

Upon final reflection: In the current position, White king on g1 is checked by Black rook on g5. If it were White's turn, and king can't move (all squares blocked), it would be checkmate already. But FEN says Black to move, so puzzle assumes Black makes a move to finalize mate. Moving knight to f3 adds a second check, making it double check, and since king can't move, it's mate.

Thus, the move is clear.
