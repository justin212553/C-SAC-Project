--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 3 moves for White. I will systematically evaluate the position, identify key pieces, assess threats, and explore candidate moves to achieve the mate.

**Step 1: Understand the Position**
- **White's Pieces**: King on a4, Queen on f6, Rook on c8, Bishop on g5, Pawns on a5 and e5.
- **Black's Pieces**: King on a7, Queen on h7, Rook on f7, Bishop on f2, Pawns on a6 and b7.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Black's King is on a7, near the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to mating attacks.
  - White's Queen on f6 and Rook on c8 are very active, controlling key lines near the Black King.
  - Black's pieces are somewhat scattered, with the Queen on h7 and Rook on f7 not directly defending the King.
  - Black's King has limited mobility due to the pawns on a6 and b7, and White's control over nearby squares.

**Step 2: Identify the Goal**
- I need a mate in 3, meaning White makes 3 moves, and after Black's responses, the final move delivers checkmate.
- This requires a sequence where Black's responses are forced or limited, ensuring the mate is inevitable.

**Step 3: Look for Candidate Moves**
- Since it's a mate in 3, the first move should likely be a strong attacking move, possibly a check, to limit Black's options.
- Let's consider moves with the Queen, Rook, or Bishop, as they are the most active pieces near Black's King.
- Possible first moves to test:
  - **Rc7+**: Rook to c7, delivering check.
  - **Qb6+**: Queen to b6, delivering check.
  - **Qe7+**: Queen to e7, delivering check.
  - Other non-check moves might be less forcing, so I'll prioritize checks.

**Step 4: Test Candidate Move 1 - Rc7+**
- **1. Rc7+**: Rook moves to c7, attacking the Black King on a7.
- Black's King can only move to b8 (since a8 is controlled by the Rook, and b6 is blocked by Black's pawn on b7).
- **Black's Response: Kb8**
- Now, White needs to continue the attack. Let's try **2. Qb6**, threatening mate on b7.
- Black can respond with **Rxe5** (or other moves), but let's see if mate follows.
- After **2. Qb6**, Black's King is on b8, and White can play **3. Qb7#**, as the Queen delivers mate on b7, and Black's King has no escape (b8 is the only square, and it's attacked).
- I need to verify Black's possible defenses after **2. Qb6**:
  - If Black plays **2...Rxe5**, it doesn't block the b7 square, so **3. Qb7#** still works.
  - If Black plays **2...Qh8**, trying to defend b8, it doesn't stop **3. Qb7#** since the Queen on h8 doesn't protect b7.
  - If Black plays **2...b6**, attacking the Queen, White still plays **3. Qb7#**, as the pawn on b6 doesn't prevent the mate (it actually blocks Black's King's escape to b6).
- This seems promising. Let's confirm all Black responses after **2. Qb6**:
  - Black's King can't move (b8 is the only square, and moving back to a7 allows Qxa7#).
  - Black can move other pieces, but none prevent **3. Qb7#**.
- Correction: If Black plays **2...b6**, it attacks the Queen on b6. If White plays **3. Qb7**, it's not checkmate because Black can capture with **bxc7**, removing the Rook on c7, and the King on b8 is no longer in check. I miscalculated.
- So, **Rc7+** followed by **Qb6** doesn't work due to **b6**. Let's try another sequence after **1. Rc7+ Kb8**.
- Alternative: After **1. Rc7+ Kb8**, try **2. Qe7**, threatening **Qb7#**.
- Black can play **2...b6**, but now White can play **3. Qb7#**, and since the Rook is still on c7, capturing with bxc7 doesn't save Black because the Queen on b7 still checks the King on b8 with no escape.
- Let's visualize: After **1. Rc7+ Kb8 2. Qe7 b6 3. Qb7+**, Black plays **bxc7**, but the Queen on b7 still checks the King on b8, and Black has no blockers or escape squares. So, it's mate.
- This seems to hold. Let's check other Black responses after **2. Qe7**:
  - If Black plays **2...Rxe5**, then **3. Qb7#** (Rook on c7 supports, no defense).
  - If Black plays **2...Qh8**, then **3. Qb7#** still works.
- This line appears to work. So, sequence is **1. Rc7+ Kb8 2. Qe7** (any move by Black) **3. Qb7#**.

**Step 5: Verify Other Candidate Moves Briefly**
- Let's quickly check **1. Qb6+** to ensure I haven't missed a shorter path.
- **1. Qb6+ Ka8** (only move, since Kb8 allows Qb7# immediately).
- Now, **2. Qxa6+ bxa6**, and White has no immediate mate (Rook can move to c7, but Black's King escapes to b7).
- This doesn't lead to mate in 3.
- Another move: **1. Qe7+ Ka8**, and again, no clear mate in 3 follows.
- So, **Rc7+** remains the best candidate.

**Step 6: Confirm the Sequence**
- Final sequence: **1. Rc7+ Kb8 2. Qe7** (threatening Qb7#), and regardless of Black's move (e.g., b6, Rxe5, Qh8, etc.), White plays **3. Qb7#**.
- This is a forced mate in 3, as Black has no way to prevent the final checkmate.

**Conclusion**: The correct sequence starts with moving the Rook to c7, delivering check, forcing the Black King to b8, followed by Queen to e7, setting up the unstoppable mate on b7.
