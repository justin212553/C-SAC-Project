--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

The position given by the FEN "8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1" indicates that it is White's turn to move. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move, meaning White must deliver checkmate immediately with their next move. Let's analyze the position systematically.

First, let's visualize the board based on the FEN:
- White pieces: King on a1, Rook on h7, Bishop on g4, Pawns on b4, c4, and c5.
- Black piece: King on a6.
- No other pieces are on the board.

Since it's a mate in 1, I need to find a move by White that puts the Black King in check with no legal moves to escape, block, or capture the checking piece.

Let's evaluate the position of the Black King on a6. The Black King is on the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to checkmate patterns. I need to see which White pieces can attack the Black King and whether Black has any escape squares or ways to respond.

The Black King's possible escape squares from a6 are a7, a5, b7, b6, and b5. I need to ensure that after White's move, the Black King is in check and none of these squares are available as escapes, nor can Black block the check or capture the checking piece.

Now, let's consider White's pieces and their potential to deliver check:
1. **Rook on h7**: The Rook is on the h-file, far from the Black King on a6. Moving the Rook to the a-file (e.g., Ra7) would place it on a7, attacking the Black King on a6, giving check. Let's see if Black has any escape:
   - Black King can move to a5, b5, b6, or b7 (a7 is occupied by the Rook after Ra7).
   - Since there are escape squares (a5, b5, b6, b7), this is not checkmate. So, Ra7 is not the solution.
   - Other Rook moves (e.g., Rh6, Rh8) don't attack the Black King directly or lead to checkmate.

2. **Bishop on g4**: The Bishop is on g4. Let's see if it can move to attack the Black King on a6. The diagonals from g4 are h5-e1 and f3-h1, neither of which includes a6. So, the Bishop cannot directly attack a6. Any move by the Bishop (e.g., Bh5, Bf3) does not put the Black King in check. Thus, the Bishop cannot deliver mate in 1.

3. **Pawns on b4, c4, c5**: Let's check if any pawn moves can deliver checkmate.
   - Pawn on b4: Can move to b5, but b5 is not attacking a6 directly (pawns attack diagonally). Moving b4 to b5 does not give check.
   - Pawn on c4: Can move to c5, but c5 is already occupied by another White pawn, so this move is illegal.
   - Pawn on c5: Can move to c6, or potentially capture if something were on b6 or d6, but there are no Black pieces there. Moving c5 to c6 places the pawn on c6, and pawns attack diagonally, so it would attack b7 and d7, not a6. So, no check.
   - Alternatively, c5 can promote to a piece by moving to c6, but even then, promoting to a Queen or Rook on c6 does not attack a6 directly (Queen on c6 attacks c7, c5, b6, d6, etc., but not a6). So, no checkmate.

At this point, none of the obvious moves seem to work. I may have missed something. Let's reconsider the Rook. Earlier, I thought Ra7 gives check but not mate because Black can escape to a5, b5, etc. Let me double-check the escape squares and see if any White pieces control those squares.

After Ra7:
- Black King on a6 is in check by the Rook on a7.
- Escape squares: a5, b7, b6, b5.
- Do White pieces control any of these squares?
  - White Pawn on b4 attacks a5 (since pawns attack diagonally). So, a5 is under attack by the b4 pawn. Black King cannot move to a5.
  - White Pawn on c5 attacks b6. So, b6 is under attack by the c5 pawn. Black King cannot move to b6.
  - White Pawn on c4 attacks b5. So, b5 is under attack by the c4 pawn. Black King cannot move to b5.
  - White Bishop on g4 does not attack b7 (diagonals are h5-e1 and f3-h1, not b7). White Rook on a7 does not attack b7 (it's on the a-file). White Pawns on b4, c4, c5 do not attack b7 (b4 attacks a5, c4 attacks b5, c5 attacks b6 and d6). So, b7 is not attacked by any White piece.

This means after Ra7+, Black King can escape to b7, which is not under attack. Therefore, Ra7 is not checkmate because Black can play Ka6-b7, escaping the check.

I must have miscounted or misunderstood something because the problem states it's a mate in 1. Let me recheck the FEN to ensure I have the correct position. FEN: "8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1". Yes, Black King on a6, White Rook on h7, Pawns on b4, c4, c5, Bishop on g4, White King on a1.

I may have miscalculated the pawn attacks. Let's list the squares attacked by White pawns again:
- Pawn on b4 (rank 4): Attacks a5 and c5. But c5 is occupied by a White pawn, so only a5 is a relevant attack square.
- Pawn on c4 (rank 4): Attacks b5 and d5. So, b5 is attacked.
- Pawn on c5 (rank 5): Attacks b6 and d6. So, b6 is attacked.

So, after Ra7+:
- Black King on a6 is in check.
- Escape squares: a5 (attacked by b4 pawn), b5 (attacked by c4 pawn), b6 (attacked by c5 pawn), b7 (not attacked by any White piece).
- Since b7 is not attacked, Black can move Ka6-b7, escaping check. So, not mate.

I need to consider if I misread the problem or position. The problem says "mate in 1", so it must be a direct checkmate. Let me try other Rook moves. What if I move the Rook to a7? I already did that. Or perhaps another square.

Let's try moving the Rook to b7. From h7 to b7 (horizontal move along rank 7):
- Rook on b7 attacks b6, b5, b4, etc., and also a7, c7, etc., but does it attack a6? No, a6 is on rank 6, not rank 7 or file b. So, Rb7 does not give check to Black King on a6. So, invalid.

I may need to reconsider the position. Let me check the FEN again. FEN shows Black King on a6, which is correct. Perhaps I need to see if the White King or something else is relevant, but the White King on a1 cannot move to attack a6 in one move.

I think I made a mistake in visualizing the board. Let me draw it out:
- Rank 8: empty
- Rank 7: Rook on h7
- Rank 6: Black King on a6
- Rank 5: Pawn on c5
- Rank 4: Pawns on b4 and c4, Bishop on g4
- Rank 3: empty
- Rank 2: empty
- Rank 1: White King on a1

Now, if I move Rook from h7 to a7 (Ra7), it is on a7, directly above a6, so it attacks a6, check. Now, Black King's escape squares:
- a5: Attacked by b4 pawn (b4 pawn attacks diagonally to a5).
- b5: Attacked by c4 pawn (c4 pawn attacks diagonally to b5).
- b6: Attacked by c5 pawn (c5 pawn attacks diagonally to b6).
- b7: Let's see which White pieces attack b7.
  - Rook on a7 attacks along a-file and 7th rank, so a7 attacks a8, a6, a5, etc., and b7, c7, d7, etc. Wait, I missed this! Rook on a7 is on rank 7, so it attacks all squares on rank 7, including b7!

I made a critical error earlier. A Rook on a7 controls the entire a-file (a8 to a1) and the entire 7th rank (a7 to h7). So, Rook on a7 attacks b7 directly because b7 is on the 7th rank.

So, correcting my earlier analysis:
- After Ra7+, Black King on a6 is in check by the Rook on a7.
- Escape squares:
  - a5: Attacked by White Pawn on b4.
  - b5: Attacked by White Pawn on c4.
  - b6: Attacked by White Pawn on c5.
  - b7: Attacked by White Rook on a7 (since Rook is on rank 7, it controls b7).
  - a7: Occupied by the White Rook itself, so not an escape square.

I need to confirm all escape squares for Black King from a6:
- a7: Occupied by White Rook after Ra7, so cannot move there.
- a5: Attacked by b4 pawn.
- b5: Attacked by c4 pawn.
- b6: Attacked by c5 pawn.
- b7: Attacked by Rook on a7 (since Rook on a7 controls the 7th rank, including b7).

Since all possible escape squares (a5, b5, b6, b7) are controlled by White pieces, and a7 is occupied, Black King has no legal moves. Additionally, Black has no other pieces to block the check or capture the Rook. Therefore, Ra7 is checkmate.

I apologize for the earlier confusion; I missed that the Rook on a7 controls the 7th rank, including b7. So, moving the Rook from h7 to a7 (Ra7) delivers checkmate because the Black King is in check and has no escape squares.

Thus, the solution is Ra7#.
