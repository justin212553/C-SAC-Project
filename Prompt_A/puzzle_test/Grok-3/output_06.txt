--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move for Black. Since it's Black's turn to move, I will evaluate the position to identify a move that immediately delivers checkmate to the White king.

First, let's break down the position:
- Black pieces: King on a8, Bishop on g5, Rook on h2, pawns on b5, c5, and c4.
- White piece: King on a3.
- Black to move.

The objective is mate in 1, so I need to find a move by Black that puts the White king in check with no legal moves to escape, block, or capture the checking piece.

Let's examine the position of the White king on a3. It's on the a-file, near the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to attacks, especially with limited escape squares. The White king can potentially move to a2, a4, or b4 (if not restricted by other pieces or checks). I need to see if any Black piece can deliver a check that prevents all escape.

Now, let's consider Black's pieces and their potential to deliver check:
1. **Black Rook on h2**: The rook is on the 2nd rank. Moving it to a2 (Ra2) would place it on the same file as the White king (a-file) and on a square adjacent to the king. This move would attack the king directly on a3, as the rook would be on a2, one square away. However, I need to confirm if this is checkmate. If Black plays Ra2, the White king is in check because the rook is directly attacking it. Now, check the escape squares:
   - a4: Not in check from the rook (rook is on a2, so a4 is not attacked vertically or horizontally by the rook).
   - a2: Blocked by the Black rook itself after Ra2.
   - b4: Not attacked by the rook on a2 (rook attacks vertically and horizontally, so b4 is diagonally adjacent and safe).
   Since the White king can move to a4 or b4, Ra2 is check but not checkmate.

2. **Black Bishop on g5**: The bishop is on a dark square, and the White king is on a3 (light square). Since bishops can only attack squares of the same color, the bishop cannot directly attack the White king. Moving the bishop (e.g., to f6, h6, etc.) won't deliver check to a3. So, no mate in 1 from the bishop.

3. **Black King on a8**: The king cannot deliver checkmate in one move as it cannot move to a square adjacent to the White king in a single move (too far away), and king moves rarely result in immediate checkmate unless in specific endgame positions, which this is not.

4. **Black Pawns on b5, c5, c4**: Let's check if any pawn can deliver checkmate.
   - Pawn on b5: Moving to b4 (b4) places it on a square diagonally adjacent to the White king on a3. In chess, a pawn attacks diagonally one square forward. Since b4 to a3 is diagonally forward for a Black pawn (moving down the board), b5 to b4 does attack a3. So, b4 puts the White king in check. Now, check for escape squares:
     - a2: Not attacked by the pawn on b4 (pawn attacks diagonally forward, so a2 is not in its path).
     - a4: Not attacked by the pawn on b4 (pawn on b4 attacks a3 and c3, not a4).
     - b4: Occupied by the Black pawn after the move.
     However, the White king can move to a2 or a4, which are not attacked by the pawn. Additionally, the king cannot capture the pawn on b4 because it’s now on b4. But since a2 and a4 are free, it's check but not checkmate.
   - Pawn on c5: Moving to c4 is not possible because c4 is already occupied by another Black pawn. No move here.
   - Pawn on c4: Moving to c3 (c3) places it on a square not directly attacking a3 (pawn on c3 attacks b2 and d2, not a3). So, no check.

After evaluating these moves, I realize I may have miscalculated the pawn's attack. Let me double-check the pawn move b5 to b4. If the Black pawn moves from b5 to b4, it is now on b4. A Black pawn on b4 attacks diagonally forward to a3 and c3. Since the White king is on a3, it is directly under attack, so it's check. Now, escape squares for the White king:
- a2: Is a2 attacked by any Black piece? The pawn on b4 attacks a3 and c3, not a2. The rook on h2 attacks horizontally on the 2nd rank (h2 to a2) and vertically on the h-file, so a2 is attacked by the rook on h2.
- a4: Is a4 attacked? The pawn on b4 attacks a3, not a4. The rook on h2 does not attack a4 (only 2nd rank and h-file). The bishop on g5 is on a dark square, a4 is light, so no attack. The pawn on c5 attacks b4 and d4, not a4. The pawn on c4 attacks b3 and d3, not a4. So a4 is not attacked.
- b4: Occupied by the Black pawn after b5-b4.

Since a2 is attacked by the rook on h2, the White king cannot move there. However, a4 is not attacked by any Black piece, so the White king can escape to a4. Therefore, b5 to b4 is check but not checkmate.

I think I missed something. Let me reconsider the rook move or other possibilities. Earlier I considered Ra2, but the White king could escape to a4 or b4. Let me check b4's status again. If the rook moves to a2, checking the king on a3:
- a4: Not attacked by rook on a2 (rook attacks a1-a3 and 2nd rank).
- b4: Is b4 attacked by any Black piece? The pawn on c5 attacks diagonally to b4 (since Black pawn on c5 attacks b4 and d4). So b4 is attacked by the pawn on c5.
- a2: Occupied by the rook.

I see now: if Black plays Ra2, the White king is in check on a3.
- Escape to a4: Not attacked by rook or any piece (pawn on c5 attacks b4/d4, pawn on b5 attacks a4 only if it moves, but it's still on b5, so b5 pawn attacks a4 and c4 diagonally. Black pawn on b5: moving down, attacks a4 and c4. Yes, so a4 is attacked by the pawn on b5.
- b4: Attacked by pawn on c5.
- a2: Occupied by rook.

I made an error earlier. The pawn on b5, being a Black pawn, attacks diagonally forward to a4 and c4. So if the rook moves to a2, checking the king:
- a4: Attacked by pawn on b5.
- b4: Attacked by pawn on c5.
- a2: Occupied by rook.

All escape squares are covered. The White king has no legal moves, and it's in check from the rook on a2. Therefore, Ra2 is checkmate.

Let me confirm:
- Rook to a2: Check on a3.
- White king possible moves: a4 (attacked by b5 pawn, since b5 pawn attacks a4), b4 (attacked by c5 pawn, since c5 pawn attacks b4), a2 (occupied by rook).
- No legal moves for White king, and no way to block or capture the rook.

Yes, this is mate in 1. I initially overlooked that the b5 pawn controls a4. So the correct move is Ra2#.

I will output this as the solution.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Ra2#
