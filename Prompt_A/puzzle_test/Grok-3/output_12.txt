--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 2 moves for Black, meaning Black moves first and must deliver checkmate on their second move, regardless of White's response.

First, I visualize the board based on the FEN:
- Black pieces: King on d3, Queen on c3, Rook on f6, Bishop on d4.
- White pieces: King on h8, Knight on g8, Bishop on e8, Rooks on h7 and a6, Rook on h1.
- It's Black's turn to move.

Since it's a mate in 2, Black's first move must set up a position where, no matter what White does, Black can deliver checkmate on the next move. I need to look for moves that either attack the White king directly or restrict its movement while preparing an unavoidable threat.

Let's examine the position of the White king on h8. It's on the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to mating patterns. The White knight on g8 and rook on h7 are nearby, potentially defending or blocking checks. The White rook on h1 and a6, and bishop on e8, are further away and might not be able to help immediately.

I start by considering Black's pieces and their potential to attack h8 or control key squares around the White king:
- Black's queen on c3 can move to various squares, including along the c-file or diagonals.
- Black's rook on f6 is already on the f-file, close to the White king, and could potentially move to f8 to attack h8 if the path is clear.
- Black's bishop on d4 controls some diagonals but doesn't directly threaten the king.
- Black's king on d3 is not likely to be involved in a direct attack.

One immediate idea is to look for a discovered check or a move that opens a line of attack. The Black rook on f6 is on the same file as the White king, but the White knight on g8 blocks the direct path to h8. If I can move the knight or force it away, the rook could potentially check the king.

However, I notice that the Black queen on c3 and the Black king on d3 are aligned in a way that might allow a discovered check if the queen moves. If the queen moves away from c3, it could uncover a check from the Black king to the White king. But in chess, kings cannot directly check each other in that way—wait, no, I misthought. The Black king on d3 and White king on h8 are not on the same file, rank, or diagonal, so there's no direct line between them. Let me correct my thinking.

Instead, I focus on the Black queen on c3. If the queen moves to a square like h3, it would attack the White king on h8 along the h-file, since h3 to h8 is a straight line on the h-file. Let's check the board: c3 to h3 is a horizontal move to the h-file, and h3 to h8 is indeed the h-file, but the White rook on h7 is in between. So Qh3 would not check the king because the rook on h7 blocks the line. However, if I can remove or deal with the rook on h7, the h-file could be a path to check.

Another idea: the Black rook on f6 can move to h6, attacking the White rook on h7. If White captures with the knight or moves the rook, I might be able to follow up. Let's test this:
- 1... Rh6, attacking the rook on h7.
- White has a few options:
  a) White plays Rxh6, capturing the rook.
  b) White moves the rook on h7 to another square, say h5.
  c) White ignores the attack and moves something else.

If 1... Rh6 and White plays 2. Rxh6, then Black can play 2... Qh3#. Wait, is that checkmate? From h3, the queen attacks h8 along the h-file, and after Rxh6, the h7 square is empty, so Qh3 to h8 is unobstructed. The White king on h8 has no escape squares: h7 is empty but moving there would still be under attack from Qh3; g8 has the White knight, so the king can't move there; g7 is not attacked directly but I need to confirm if the king can escape.

Let's visualize after 1... Rh6 2. Rxh6 Qh3#:
- Black queen on h3 attacks h8.
- White king on h8 can try to move to g7 or h7.
- h7 is empty, so king to h7, but Qh3 still attacks h7 (since it's the h-file), so that's not an escape.
- g7: is g7 attacked? Black has no piece attacking g7 directly (queen on h3 attacks h-file and 3rd rank, not g7; rook is gone; bishop on d4 attacks b2-g7 diagonal, yes, d4 to g7 is a diagonal, so bishop attacks g7).
- So if White king moves to g7, it's still in check from the bishop on d4.

I see now: Black bishop on d4 is on the b2-g7 diagonal, so it attacks g7. Therefore, White king on h8, after Qh3, cannot escape to g7 because it's attacked by the bishop, and cannot go to h7 because it's attacked by the queen. And g8 is occupied by the knight. So, yes, Qh3# is checkmate if the h7 rook is gone.

Now, back to White's responses after 1... Rh6:
- If 2. Rxh6, then 2... Qh3# works, as established.
- If White moves the rook elsewhere, say 2. Rh5, then the h-file is still blocked by the rook on h5, so Qh3 wouldn't check. I need a different follow-up.
- After 1... Rh6 2. Rh5, can I play 2... Qg3 or something? Qg3 attacks g7 and h3, but not directly h8. Wait, no: queen on g3 would attack h4 (diagonal) and g-file, but not h8. Perhaps I need to rethink.

I am considering if 1... Rh6 forces White to move the rook or capture, but if White moves the rook to h5 or elsewhere on the h-file, the h-file remains blocked. Maybe I can capture the rook with another piece.

I am considering a different first move. What if Black plays 1... Qh3 immediately? Currently, h7 has a White rook, so Qh3 doesn't check the king. White can respond in various ways, like moving the rook or blocking. This doesn't seem to force anything, as White can just move the rook or do something else, and I don't have an immediate mate threat.

I am considering a move that attacks the knight on g8, since it's a defender of the king. Black's rook on f6 can move to g6, attacking the knight on g8. So, 1... Rg6.
- If White moves the knight, say 2. Nf6, then the g-file is open, and I can play 2... Qg3#, since queen on g3 attacks g8 and h8 along the rank and file. Wait, no: queen on g3 to h8 is not a direct line; I miscalculated. Queen on g3 attacks g-file and 3rd rank, so g8 but not h8. King is on h8, so Qg3 doesn't attack h8. My mistake.
- If 1... Rg6 2. Nf6, then perhaps 2... Rh6#, rook to h6 attacks h8, and king can't escape: h7 has White rook, g7 is attacked by bishop on d4, g8 is empty now (knight moved), but king to g8 is possible unless another piece attacks g8. Queen on c3 can move to g3, but as I saw, it doesn't attack h8. Actually, after Nf6, the knight on f6 blocks the f-file, but my rook moved to g6, so it's not relevant.

This is getting messy. Let me try a different approach. I recall that in mate-in-2 puzzles, often the first move is a quiet move or a sacrifice that lures a defender away. I am considering sacrificing the rook more decisively.

Going back to 1... Rh6, I saw that if White captures 2. Rxh6, then 2... Qh3# works. Now, what if White doesn't capture and moves the rook elsewhere, like 2. Rh5? Then the h-file is still blocked. Can I still mate? If rook is on h5, h7 is empty, but h5 blocks Qh3 to h8. I can play 2... Qg3, and now queen on g3 attacks g7 and threatens Qh4-h8 or something. Let's see White king's escapes:
- King on h8, if moves to h7, Qg3 attacks 3rd rank, so Qg3 to h3 doesn't attack h7. Wait, no: queen on g3 attacks g-file (g1-g8) and 3rd rank (a3-h3), so it doesn't attack h7 or g7 diagonally. My bishop on d4 attacks g7, as established.
- So after 1... Rh6 2. Rh5 Qg3, White king on h8 can move to h7 (not attacked by queen or bishop), or g7 (attacked by bishop), or g8 (attacked by queen on g3). So king to h7 escapes check, meaning Qg3 is not checkmate.

This line fails. I need a first move that covers all of White's responses.

I am considering a different move. What about 1... Qg3 directly? Queen to g3 attacks g8 (where the knight is) and the 3rd rank. Now, White must respond:
- If White moves the knight, say 2. Nf6, then the g-file is open, but my queen is already on g3, so it attacks g8, but king is on h8. I can play 2... Rh6#, rook to h6 attacks h8. Now, king on h8, escapes: h7 (blocked by rook), g7 (attacked by bishop d4), g8 (attacked by queen on g3). So yes, no escape, it's mate.
- If White doesn't move the knight and plays something like 2. Rh5, then 2... Rh6# still, because rook to h6 attacks h8, and king escapes: h7 blocked, g7 attacked by bishop, g8 attacked by queen. So mate.

Let's confirm all White responses after 1... Qg3:
- 2. Nf6 (or any knight move), then 2... Rh6#. King on h8: can't go h7 (White rook), g7 (bishop d4), g8 (queen g3). Mate.
- 2. Rh5 (or any rook move on h-file), 2... Rh6#. Same as above, mate.
- 2. Move another piece, like Ra7 or something, still 2... Rh6#, same mate pattern.

Is g8 really attacked by queen on g3? Queen on g3 is on the g-file, so yes, g1 to g8 are all attacked. So king can't go to g8. And bishop on d4 attacks g7 (d4 to g7 is diagonal: d4-e5-f6-g7), confirmed. And h7 has White rook, so king is trapped.

This seems to work. So 1... Qg3 forces White into a position where 2... Rh6# delivers mate no matter what White does.

I thought earlier Qg3 doesn't attack h8, which is true, but Rh6 does, and Qg3 prevents escape to g8. Perfect.

Let me double-check if White has any other tricky moves. If White plays 2. Kh7 after 1... Qg3, but h7 has White rook, so king can't move there. King is on h8, h7 is occupied by White rook, so king has no legal moves actually, because:
- h7: occupied by own rook.
- g7: attacked by Black bishop d4.
- g8: occupied by own knight (initially, unless knight moves).

If knight moves, g8 becomes empty but is attacked by Qg3. I said earlier king can't move at all unless knight moves, but if knight moves, g8 is attacked. So in all cases, after 1... Qg3, White can't escape the threat of 2... Rh6#.

This seems correct. So the solution is 1... Qg3 followed by 2... Rh6# in response to any White move.

I will write it in PGN format as instructed.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qg3 2. Nf6 Rh6#
