--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **7r/8/2KQ4/3B4/8/r4R2/7r/4b1nk w - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 2 moves for White. This means White must make a move now, Black must respond, and White's second move must deliver checkmate, regardless of Black's response.

First, I visualize the board based on the FEN:
- White pieces: King on d6, Queen on c6, Bishop on d5, Rook on f3.
- Black pieces: King on h1, Knight on g1, Bishop on e1, Rooks on h8, a3, and h2.
- It's White's turn to move.

Since it's a mate in 2, White's first move must set up a situation where, no matter what Black does, White can deliver checkmate on the next move. This often involves a strong attacking move that limits Black's options, such as a check or a move that threatens an unavoidable mate.

I start by identifying the key elements of the position:
- Black's King is on h1, in the corner, with limited mobility. It's blocked by its own pieces: a Knight on g1 and a Rook on h2. This suggests that attacks targeting h1 or forcing the King to move to a vulnerable square could be effective.
- White has powerful pieces: a Queen on c6, a Rook on f3, a Bishop on d5, and a King on d6. The Queen and Rook are particularly well-placed for attacks near the Black King.
- Black's pieces are somewhat scattered, with Rooks on h8, h2, and a3, a Knight on g1, and a Bishop on e1. Most of these pieces are not in a position to defend the King effectively against a direct assault.

Now, I consider candidate moves for White that could lead to mate in 2. The most promising approach is to look for checks or moves that threaten mate directly, forcing Black into a limited set of responses.

**Candidate Move 1: Qg6+**
- Move the Queen from c6 to g6, delivering check.
- Black's King is on h1. Possible responses:
  - Kh1-h2 (move to h2, but there's a Black Rook there, so illegal).
  - Kh1xg1 (capture the Knight on g1, moving to g1).
- If Black plays Kxg1, then White can play Qxh2#. The Queen captures the Rook on h2, and it's checkmate because the Black King on g1 has no escape squares (blocked by White's Rook on f3 and the edge of the board).
- This seems promising. Let's confirm if Black has other responses. The Black King can't move to h2 due to the Rook, and g1 is the only legal move. Black can't block the check with another piece because the Queen is directly adjacent to the King on the g-file. Black can't capture the Queen either. So, Kxg1 is forced, and Qxh2# works.
- This looks like a mate in 2: 1. Qg6+ Kxg1 2. Qxh2#.

**Verification of Qg6+**
- After 1. Qg6+, Black's only legal move is Kxg1 (since h2 is occupied and no other squares are available).
- Then, 2. Qxh2+: The Queen captures the Rook on h2, and it's check. The Black King on g1 can't move to f1 (blocked by White's Rook on f3), can't move to h1 or h2 (edge of board and occupied), and can't move to g2 (blocked by the edge and no diagonal escape). No Black piece can capture the Queen or block the check. So, it's mate.
- This sequence works.

**Exploring Other Candidates (to ensure no better or alternative solutions)**
- **Candidate Move 2: Qh6+**
  - Queen to h6, check.
  - Black can respond with Kg1 (capturing the Knight) or Kh2 (but h2 has a Rook, so illegal). Only Kg1 is possible.
  - After Kg1, White can play Qxh2#, same as above.
  - This also works, but it's essentially the same idea as Qg6+. However, Qh6+ might be riskier if there were other Black pieces, but in this case, it's fine. Still, Qg6+ feels more direct.
- **Candidate Move 3: Rh3+**
  - Rook to h3, check.
  - Black can respond with Kg1 or Kh2 (but h2 is occupied, so only Kg1).
  - After Kg1, White has no immediate mate. Qg6 or Qh6 would not be mate yet because Black has responses. For example, after 1. Rh3+ Kg1 2. Qg6, Black can play Rh7 or something to block. It's not forced mate.
  - So, Rh3+ doesn't work for mate in 2.
- **Candidate Move 4: Qf6+ or other Queen checks**
  - Qf6+ leads to Kg1, and then White doesn't have an immediate mate (e.g., Qxh2+ is check but Black can move back or something). It's not forced.
  - Other moves like Qe8+ or Qd7+ are far from the King and don't threaten immediate mate.
- **Other Moves: Bishop or King moves**
  - Moving the Bishop (e.g., Bf7) doesn't deliver check or threaten mate.
  - Moving the King is unlikely to contribute to a mate in 2.

**Conclusion of Analysis**
- The move 1. Qg6+ forces Black to play Kxg1, and then 2. Qxh2# is checkmate. This is a clear and forced sequence.
- Alternatively, 1. Qh6+ achieves the same result with Kxg1 and Qxh2#. However, Qg6+ is often preferred in such puzzles for being a more natural or direct move, though both are correct.
- I double-checked Black's possible responses, and there are no other legal moves for Black after the initial check except Kxg1. No interpositions or captures are possible.
- Therefore, the solution is confirmed.

**Final Note**
- I will present the solution in PGN format as requested, using Qg6+ as the first move since it is equally valid and slightly more intuitive (moving closer to the King on the g-file).

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qg6+ Kxg1 2. Qxh2#
