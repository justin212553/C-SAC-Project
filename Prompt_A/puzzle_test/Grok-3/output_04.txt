--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1**. This position indicates it is Black's turn to move, and the goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move (Mate in 1). I will break down the position, evaluate the pieces, and identify the key moves that lead to checkmate.

First, let's visualize the board based on the FEN:
- Black has a king on b5 and a rook on e4.
- White has a king on g1 and three pawns on f2, g2, and h2.
- There are no other pieces on the board.

Since it's Black's turn and we need a mate in 1, I need to find a move for Black that immediately puts the White king in checkmate. Checkmate means the White king is in check and has no legal moves to escape the check (no way to move the king, block the check, or capture the checking piece).

Let's consider the position of the White king on g1. It is on the first rank, near the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to attacks, especially with limited escape squares. The White pawns on f2, g2, and h2 are directly in front of the king, blocking some potential escape paths but also potentially restricting the king's movement.

Now, let's evaluate Black's pieces:
- The Black king on b5 is not directly involved in delivering checkmate since kings cannot give check from a distance.
- The Black rook on e4 is a powerful piece that can control ranks and files. I need to see if moving the rook can deliver a check to the White king and prevent any escape.

I will test possible moves for the Black rook to see if any position results in checkmate. A rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. Let's consider moving the rook along the e-file or the 4th rank.

1. **Moving the rook along the e-file**:
   - If I move the rook to e1 (Re1), the rook would be on the first rank, directly attacking the White king on g1. This move puts the White king in check because the rook controls the entire first rank from e1 to h1, and g1 is on that rank.
   - Now, I need to check if the White king can escape this check:
     - **Move the king**: The White king on g1 can potentially move to f1, g2, or h1 (since it's on the edge, fewer squares are available).
       - f1: This square is on the first rank, which is controlled by the Black rook on e1. So, f1 is under attack.
       - h1: Similarly, h1 is on the first rank, controlled by the rook.
       - g2: This square is on the second rank. However, there is a White pawn on g2, so the king cannot move there as it is occupied by its own piece.
     - **Block the check**: The check is along the first rank. To block it, White would need to place a piece between the rook on e1 and the king on g1 (i.e., on f1). However, White only has pawns on f2, g2, and h2, and none of them can move to f1 (pawns cannot move sideways or backward). The White king cannot block either, as it is the piece in check.
     - **Capture the checking piece**: The Black rook is on e1, and no White piece can reach e1 to capture it. The White king cannot move to e1 (it would still be in check along the rank), and the pawns cannot reach e1.
   - Since the White king cannot move to a safe square, cannot block the check, and cannot capture the rook, this is checkmate.

I should double-check if there are other possible moves for Black that could also deliver mate in 1, to ensure I haven't missed anything.
2. **Moving the rook elsewhere**:
   - If I move the rook to e2 (Re2), it attacks along the second rank, but the White king on g1 is not on the second rank, so it's not in check.
   - If I move the rook to e3, e5, e6, e7, or e8, none of these positions attack the White king directly on g1 (different rank and file).
   - If I move the rook horizontally along the 4th rank to a4, b4, c4, d4, f4, g4, or h4, none of these positions attack the White king on g1 (different file and rank, and the rook doesn't control the first rank or g-file from these positions).
3. **Moving the Black king**:
   - Moving the Black king (e.g., to a5, a6, b6, c6, c5, c4, b4, or a4) does not deliver check to the White king, as kings cannot check from a distance, and the position of the Black rook remains unchanged.

After this analysis, it is clear that the only move that delivers checkmate is moving the Black rook from e4 to e1 (Re1). This move places the White king in check along the first rank, and White has no legal moves to escape:
- The king cannot move to f1 or h1 (controlled by the rook).
- The king cannot move to g2 (blocked by its own pawn).
- No piece can block the check or capture the rook.

Thus, Re1 is the solution to this mate in 1 puzzle. I will now output the move in the required PGN format, ensuring proper move numbering and notation for checkmate.
