--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 4 moves for Black. Since it's Black to move, I will evaluate the position, identify key threats, and systematically search for a sequence that forces checkmate regardless of White's responses.

First, let's understand the position. Black has a king on g8, a queen on b2, and a rook on g2. White has a king on h4, a queen on e3, a rook on c7, and pawns on a3, f4, g4, and h3. Black's pieces are well-positioned near the White king, which is somewhat exposed on h4. The Black rook on g2 is attacking the g-file, and the Black queen on b2 can potentially coordinate with the rook to create threats. White's rook on c7 is far from the action, and White's queen on e3 might try to defend or counterattack.

Since it's a mate in 4, Black needs to deliver checkmate on the fourth move. This means I need a sequence of moves where each Black move either delivers a check or sets up an unavoidable checkmate, and White's responses are forced or limited in such a way that they cannot prevent the mate. I will start by looking for forcing moves, such as checks, that limit White's options.

**Step 1: Identify Candidate Moves for Black**

Let's consider Black's possible moves that deliver check or create immediate threats:

- **Rg3+**: The rook moves to g3, delivering check to the White king on h4. This forces the king to move, as there are no interposing pieces or captures possible to block the check.
- **Qe5+**: The queen moves to e5, delivering check. This also forces a response from White, either by moving the king or interposing with the queen.
- Other moves like Qb1 or Qa2 don't deliver check and seem less forcing, so I'll prioritize moves that apply immediate pressure.

I’ll start with **Rg3+** because it directly attacks the king and limits its mobility. The White king on h4 can only move to h5 (since h3 is occupied by a White pawn and g3 is now occupied by the Black rook). Let's see the consequences:

1. **Rg3+**
   - White's only legal move is **Kh5**.
   - After Kh5, the White king is on the edge of the board, which often makes it easier to trap. Now Black can follow up with another check or a move that restricts the king further.

**Step 2: Follow-Up After Rg3+ and Kh5**

With the White king on h5, Black can consider moves like:

- **Rh3**: This pins the h-pawn and threatens mate on h5 with the rook. However, White can respond with **Kg6**, escaping the immediate threat, or **Qf3** to defend. This doesn't seem immediately decisive.
- **Qb1**: This moves the queen to a position where it can potentially deliver mate on h1 if the king is forced back. Let's visualize: if Black plays Qb1, threatening Qh1#, White can respond with **Qf3** or **Qe4** to block the diagonal. This isn't forcing enough.
- **Qe5+**: This delivers another check. If Black plays Qe5+, White's king can move to g6 or h6, or White can interpose with Qf3. Let's test this:
  - If White plays **Kg6**, Black can play **Qf6+**, forcing **Kh5**, and then **Rh3#** seems possible. Let's write this down.

Sequence so far:
1. Rg3+ Kh5
2. Qe5+ Kg6
3. Qf6+ Kh5
4. Rh3#

This looks promising. Let's verify if White has any defenses at each step.

**Step 3: Verify White's Responses**

- After 1. Rg3+:
  - White must play **Kh5**. No other legal moves exist (king can't go to g5 because of the pawn on g4, can't go to h3 because of the pawn, and g3 is occupied by the rook).
- After 2. Qe5+:
  - White has several options:
    - **Kg6**: As above, leads to 3. Qf6+ Kh5 4. Rh3#.
    - **Kh6**: If the king moves to h6, Black can play 3. Qf6+ (check), forcing the king back to h5 (Kh5), and then 4. Rh3#.
    - **Qf3**: White interposes the queen to block the check. Then Black can play 3. Qxf3+ (capturing the queen, still check), and White must move the king to g6 (Kg6), then 4. Qf6# delivers mate since the king has no escape squares (g7 is attacked by the queen, h5 by the rook, h6 by the queen).
- Let's confirm the last line:
  1. Rg3+ Kh5
  2. Qe5+ Qf3
  3. Qxf3+ Kg6
  4. Qf6#

Yes, this works. The king on g6 is attacked by the queen on f6, and escape squares g7, h6, and h5 are all covered (g7 and h6 by the queen, h5 by the rook on g3).

- Another response after 2. Qe5+ is **Qd4** (interposing). Then Black plays 3. Qxd4+ Kg6 4. Qf6# (same as above).

I notice that in all lines, Black's moves force White into positions where the king is trapped. Let me double-check if White has any other tricky defenses, like moving the rook to counterattack. For example, after 1. Rg3+ Kh5 2. Qe5+, White could play **Rc8+** to check the Black king. But Black's king can move to h7 or f7, and White's king is still in danger. Let's test:
- 1. Rg3+ Kh5
- 2. Qe5+ Rc8+
- 3. Kh7 (or Kf7), and White's check is over, while Black still threatens mate with Qf6+ or Rh3#. For instance, 3...Qf6+ 4. Kh5 Rh3# still works.

Since the mate must be delivered in 4 moves, and in this sideline, Black's king move is move 3, followed by mate on move 4, it still fits. However, I realize I may have miscounted earlier. In standard chess notation, a mate in 4 means Black plays 4 moves to deliver mate. Let's clarify the sequence:

Standard notation for mate in 4 (since Black moves first):
- Black's 1st move
- White's response
- Black's 2nd move
- White's response
- Black's 3rd move
- White's response
- Black's 4th move (delivering mate)

In my earlier sequence:
1. Rg3+ Kh5
2. Qe5+ Kg6
3. Qf6+ Kh5
4. Rh3#

This is perfect; Black's fourth move is Rh3#, delivering mate. Similarly, in the line with Qf3:
1. Rg3+ Kh5
2. Qe5+ Qf3
3. Qxf3+ Kg6
4. Qf6#

Again, mate on the fourth move. I need to ensure all White responses are covered. Let's try one more response after 2. Qe5+:
- If White plays **Kh4** (king back to h4), then Black can play 3. Qg3+ (queen and rook both on g3, but that's illegal as two pieces can't occupy the same square). My mistake. If White plays Kh4, then Black can play 3. Rh3+ (check), forcing Kg5 (only move), then 4. Qf6# (mate, as king can't escape).

Correcting:
1. Rg3+ Kh5
2. Qe5+ Kh4
3. Rh3+ Kg5
4. Qf6#

This also works. King on g5, attacked by queen on f6, can't move to f5 (pawn on f4), g6 (queen), h6 (queen), h5 (rook), or h4 (rook). Perfect.

**Step 4: Confirm No Escapes**

I’ve covered the main responses:
- Kh5 -> Qe5+ -> Kg6/Kh6/Kh4/Qf3/Qd4/Rc8+ all lead to mate on move 4.
- White's rook checks don't save the position because Black's king can escape, and the mating net remains.

I believe this sequence is correct. Initially, I considered other first moves like Qe5+ directly, but Rg3+ seems more forcing as it restricts the king immediately to one square.

**Conclusion**

The sequence starting with Rg3+ forces the White king into a trap, and subsequent checks with the queen and rook coordination ensure mate in 4 moves. I will now output the main line in PGN format as instructed.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rg3+ 2. Kh5 Qe5+ 3. Kg6 Qf6+ 4. Kh5 Rh3#
