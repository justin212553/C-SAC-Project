--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move, meaning Black must deliver checkmate immediately with their next move.

First, let's break down the position:
- Black pieces: King on f8, Queen on f7, Knight on g7, Bishop on g6.
- White piece: King on h8.
- It's Black's turn to move.

Since it's a mate in 1, I need to find a move by Black that puts the White king in check with no legal moves to escape. The White king is on h8, which is a corner square, making it vulnerable to checkmate patterns, especially with multiple attacking pieces nearby.

Let's evaluate the position of the White king:
- The White king on h8 can potentially move to g8 or h7 if not in check or if those squares are not controlled by Black.
- I need to see if any Black piece can deliver a check that prevents the White king from escaping.

Now, let's consider the Black pieces and their possible moves:
1. **Black Queen on f7**: The queen is a powerful piece that can control many squares. From f7, it can move to h7 (diagonally), which is adjacent to the White king on h8. Moving the queen to h7 (Qh7) would place the White king in check because the queen attacks h8 directly. Now, I need to check if the White king has any escape squares:
   - g8: Is g8 attacked by any Black piece? The Black knight on g7 attacks g8 (knights attack in an L-shape, so from g7, it controls g8). Therefore, g8 is not a safe square for the White king.
   - h7: This square is occupied by the Black queen after the move Qh7, so the White king cannot move there.
   - The White king has no other adjacent squares to move to (h8 is a corner).
   - Additionally, White has no other pieces to block the check or capture the queen.
   Thus, Qh7 appears to be a checkmate move.

2. **Black Knight on g7**: Let's see if the knight can deliver checkmate. The knight on g7 already attacks h5 and f5, but moving it to f5 or h5 does not directly attack the White king on h8. A knight on f6 would attack h7 and h5, but not h8 directly. Moving the knight does not seem to deliver an immediate check, so it cannot be the solution for mate in 1.

3. **Black Bishop on g6**: The bishop is on the dark square g6, and the White king is on h8, also a dark square. The bishop can move along the diagonal to h7, which would place the White king in check. Let's evaluate:
   - Bishop to h7 (Bh7) puts the White king in check.
   - Escape squares for the White king: g8 is attacked by the Black knight on g7, and h7 is now occupied by the Black bishop. So, no escape squares are available.
   - White has no pieces to block or capture.
   Thus, Bh7 also appears to be a checkmate move.

4. **Black King on f8**: The king cannot deliver checkmate directly as it cannot move to a square that attacks the White king in one move (kings move only one square, and f8 to h8 is too far).

At this point, I have two candidate moves that seem to deliver checkmate: Qh7 and Bh7. Let's double-check both to ensure accuracy:
- **Qh7+**: Queen moves to h7, checks the White king on h8. White king cannot move to g8 (attacked by knight on g7) or h7 (occupied by queen). No other moves. This is checkmate (Qh7#).
- **Bh7+**: Bishop moves to h7, checks the White king on h8. White king cannot move to g8 (attacked by knight on g7) or h7 (occupied by bishop). No other moves. This is also checkmate (Bh7#).

Both moves seem to work, but in chess puzzles, especially mate in 1, there is typically one intended solution. However, since the problem does not specify a unique move and both achieve the goal, I will note that both are valid. For the purpose of providing a solution, I will choose one, as the output requires a single PGN sequence.

I will select Qh7# as the solution since the queen is often a key piece in delivering checkmate in such positions, though Bh7# is equally valid. Let's confirm once more:
- After Qh7, Black pieces control all escape squares (knight on g7 controls g8, queen on h7 controls h7 and h8). Checkmate.
- After Bh7, same logic applies (knight on g7 controls g8, bishop on h7 controls h7 and h8). Checkmate.

Since the problem is mate in 1 and does not specify which piece to use, either is correct, but I will output one for clarity.
