--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **8/6q1/8/7k/4Q3/7P/2r2p1K/5R2 b - - 0 1**. This indicates it's Black's turn to move, and the goal is to find a forced checkmate in 3 moves (Mate in 3). I will systematically evaluate the position, identify key candidate moves for Black, and ensure that every response by White leads to checkmate within the specified number of moves.

First, let's visualize the board based on the FEN:
- Black pieces: Queen on g7, Rook on c2, King on h5, Pawn on f2.
- White pieces: Queen on e4, Rook on f1, King on h2, Pawn on h3.
- Black to move.

The objective for Black is to deliver checkmate in 3 moves, meaning Black will make the first and third moves, and White will respond in between. I need to find a sequence where, no matter how White responds, Black can force checkmate on the third move.

### Step 1: Assess the Position
- Black has a strong attacking setup with the Queen on g7 and Rook on c2, both potentially targeting the White King on h2.
- The White King is somewhat confined on h2, with limited escape squares due to the Black Pawn on f2 and Black King on h5 controlling some adjacent squares.
- White's Queen on e4 and Rook on f1 could potentially defend or counterattack, so I must consider all possible responses.
- Black's Pawn on f2 is close to promotion, which could be a decisive factor.

### Step 2: Identify Candidate Moves for Black
Since it's a mate in 3, Black's first move must create a threat that forces White into a limited set of responses, all of which allow Black to mate on the next move. Let's consider powerful moves that either check the White King or create an unstoppable threat.

**Candidate Move 1: 1... Qg2+**
- This moves the Queen to g2, delivering check to the White King on h2.
- White's possible responses:
  - 2. Kh1 (moving to the only available square).
  - After 2. Kh1, Black can play 2... Qxh3+ (capturing the pawn and giving check), forcing 3. Kg1, and then 3... Qg2# (checkmate, as the King has no escape squares).
- This seems promising. Let's check if White has other responses to 1... Qg2+.
- White cannot block the check or capture the Queen, as no pieces can interpose or attack g2. So, 2. Kh1 is forced.
- This line works: 1... Qg2+ 2. Kh1 Qxh3+ 3. Kg1 Qg2#.

**Candidate Move 2: 1... f1=Q+**
- Promoting the pawn to a Queen with check.
- White's responses:
  - 2. Rxf1 (capturing the new Queen).
  - Then Black can play 2... Qg2+ 3. Kh1 Qxh3#, which is mate.
  - Alternatively, if White plays 2. Kh1, then 2... Qg2+ 3. Kg1 Qxh3#, but this doesn't work because after 2. Kh1, Black's 2... Qg2+ allows 3. Kg1, and Black's Queen on g2 is not supported to deliver mate immediately (White's King can escape or other moves interfere).
- This line is less clear because after 2. Rxf1, Black's 2... Qg2+ 3. Kh1 Qxh3# works, but I need to ensure all White responses are covered. Let's test other White moves after 1... f1=Q+.
- If White plays 2. Qxf1, same as Rxf1, Black can continue similarly.
- However, this line feels less forcing than 1... Qg2+, as it gives White more options to capture the promoted piece.

**Candidate Move 3: 1... f1=R+**
- Promoting to a Rook with check.
- Similar to above, White can capture with 2. Qxf1 or 2. Rxf1, and Black can try 2... Qg2+, but again, it’s less direct than the Queen move.

**Candidate Move 4: 1... Rc1**
- Moving the Rook to c1 to threaten mate on h1 or other ideas, but this doesn’t deliver an immediate check, and White has many responses (e.g., moving the King, Queen, or Rook). This is unlikely to force mate in 3.

### Step 3: Deepen Analysis on 1... Qg2+
Let's confirm the line with 1... Qg2+:
- 1... Qg2+ forces 2. Kh1 (only legal move, as h3 is occupied by White's pawn, and other squares are not accessible).
- Then 2... Qxh3+ (capturing the pawn and giving check).
- White is forced to 3. Kg1 (only legal move, as h1 is attacked by the Queen, and other squares are not available).
- Then 3... Qg2# (checkmate, as the White King on g1 has no escape squares: f2 is occupied by Black's pawn, h2 is attacked by the Queen, h1 is attacked, and other squares are out of reach).

I need to double-check if White has any other moves or if I missed a defense. After 1... Qg2+, White's King must move to h1; there are no interpositions or captures possible. After 2... Qxh3+, White's King must move to g1, and no other pieces can block or capture. The mate with 3... Qg2# is unavoidable.

### Step 4: Verify Move Legality and Count
- Move 1: Black plays Qg2+, White responds Kh1.
- Move 2: Black plays Qxh3+, White responds Kg1.
- Move 3: Black plays Qg2#, checkmate.
- This is indeed a mate in 3, as Black's third move delivers mate.

### Step 5: Consider Alternative Lines
I briefly considered 1... f1=Q+, but after 2. Rxf1 or 2. Qxf1, Black can still play 2... Qg2+ 3. Kh1 Qxh3#, which also works. However, 1... Qg2+ is more direct and forces the King into position immediately without giving White additional options to capture or complicate the position. Since 1... Qg2+ has no alternative responses for White, it’s the cleanest solution.

### Conclusion
The sequence starting with 1... Qg2+ leads to a forced checkmate in 3 moves, covering all possible responses by White. I will now present the solution in PGN format as instructed.
