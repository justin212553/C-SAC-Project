--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1**. This position indicates it is Black's turn to move, and the goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move (Mate in 1). First, I will break down the position to understand the placement of the pieces and the possible moves.

- **Piece Placement**:
  - Black has a king on e3, a pawn on f3, and a pawn on f2.
  - White has a king on f1.
- **Objective**: Black to move and deliver checkmate in 1 move.

Since it's a mate in 1, Black must make a single move that puts the White king in check, with no legal moves for White to escape the check. Let's evaluate the position of the White king on f1. The White king is on the first rank, near the edge of the board, which often suggests possibilities for checkmate if it can be trapped or attacked directly.

Now, let's consider Black's possible moves:
1. **Black King Moves**: The Black king on e3 can move to various squares (d2, d3, d4, e2, e4, f2, f3, f4). However, moving the king cannot directly attack the White king on f1 since kings cannot move to adjacent squares of the opposing king (they would be in check themselves). For example, if Black moves Ke3 to f2, it would be adjacent to the White king on f1, which is illegal as kings cannot be on adjacent squares. So, king moves cannot deliver checkmate.
2. **Black Pawn Moves**:
   - The pawn on f3 can move to f2, but f2 is already occupied by another Black pawn, so this move is blocked and illegal.
   - The pawn on f2 can move forward to f1, which would be a promotion since it reaches the first rank. Upon promotion, Black can choose to promote the pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.

Let's focus on the pawn on f2 moving to f1 with promotion. If Black promotes to a queen (f2 to f1=Q), the new queen on f1 would be directly adjacent to the White king on f1. However, in chess, pieces cannot occupy the same square as another piece, and the White king is already on f1. This suggests a potential misinterpretation. Upon rechecking the FEN, I realize I may have misread the position. Let me correct my visualization:
- FEN: **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2**:
  - Rank 8: empty
  - Rank 7: empty
  - Rank 6: empty
  - Rank 5: empty
  - Rank 4: empty
  - Rank 3: Black pawn on e3, Black king on f3 (I misread earlier as king on e3 and pawn on f3)
  - Correcting: Looking at the FEN, "4pk2" on rank 3 means 4 empty, then p (Black pawn on e3), k (Black king on f3), 2 empty.
  - Rank 2: 5 empty, Black pawn on f2, 2 empty.
  - Rank 1: 5 empty, White king on f1, 2 empty.

I apologize for the earlier confusion. Correct position:
- Black king on f3.
- Black pawns on e3 and f2.
- White king on f1.

Now, reevaluating Black's moves:
1. **Black King on f3**: Can move to e2, e3, e4, f2, f4, g2, g3, g4. However, moving to f2 is illegal because it's occupied by Black's own pawn. Moving to e2 or g2 would place it adjacent to the White king on f1, which is illegal as kings cannot be adjacent. Other king moves (e3, e4, f4, g3, g4) do not attack the White king directly and thus cannot deliver checkmate.
2. **Black Pawn on e3**: Can move to e2 (single move forward). Moving to e2 does not attack the White king on f1, as e2 is not adjacent to f1 in a way that a pawn can check (pawns attack diagonally). So, no check.
3. **Black Pawn on f2**: This pawn is on the second rank and can move to f1, the first rank, which requires promotion. Upon reaching f1, it must be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. However, f1 is occupied by the White king. In chess, a pawn cannot move to a square occupied by another piece, even if it's the opponent's king, because pieces cannot share squares. Moving a pawn to a square occupied by the opponent's king is not a legal move; it's simply blocked.

I see the issue now. I must have misread the FEN or the problem setup. Let me double-check the FEN string: **5K2** on rank 1 means 5 empty, White king on f1, 2 empty. Rank 2 is **5p2**, meaning 5 empty, Black pawn on f2, 2 empty. This confirms the Black pawn is on f2 and White king on f1, same file. A pawn cannot move forward to a square occupied by any piece, so f2 to f1 is not a legal move because f1 is occupied by the White king. This move is invalid.

At this point, I suspect there might be an error in my interpretation or in the problem statement. Since it's a mate in 1, and none of the moves seem to work, let me reconsider the FEN or visualize again. Let's list all legal moves for Black:
- Black king on f3: legal moves are e4, f4, g4, g3, g2 (but g2 is adjacent to f1, illegal), e3 (but e3 is occupied by Black pawn, illegal). Correcting: rank 3 is "4pk2", so e3 is Black pawn, f3 is Black king. Legal moves for Black king on f3 are:
  - e4, f4, g4, g3, g2, e2, but:
  - e2 and g2 are adjacent to White king on f1 (distance of 1 in rank and file), so illegal.
  - e3 is occupied by Black pawn, so illegal.
  - So legal king moves: e4, f4, g4, g3.
  - None of these attack White king on f1.
- Black pawn on e3: can move to e2. Moving to e2 does not check White king on f1.
- Black pawn on f2: cannot move to f1 because f1 is occupied by White king. Move is illegal.

I am considering if I misunderstood the FEN. Let me decode it again carefully:
- FEN: **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1**
- Rank 8: 8 empty
- Rank 7: 8 empty
- Rank 6: 8 empty
- Rank 5: 8 empty
- Rank 4: 8 empty
- Rank 3: 4 empty (a3-d3), p (e3 Black pawn), k (f3 Black king), 2 empty (g3-h3)
- Rank 2: 5 empty (a2-e2), p (f2 Black pawn), 2 empty (g2-h2)
- Rank 1: 5 empty (a1-e1), K (f1 White king), 2 empty (g1-h1)

Confirmed: Black king f3, Black pawns e3 and f2, White king f1. Now, Black pawn on f2 to f1 is illegal because f1 is occupied. No other move delivers check. I suspect the FEN might be incorrect or I misread the problem. Perhaps the White king is on a different square. Let me check if the FEN was mistyped or if it's a different position.

Upon rethinking, I notice the problem states "mate in 1", and it's Black to move. If no legal move delivers mate, perhaps the FEN is wrong. Let me hypothesize: if the White king was on g1 instead of f1, then Black pawn f2 to f1 promoting to queen would check the king on g1 (queen on f1 attacks g1 diagonally), and White king on g1 has no escape squares (g2 is attacked by Black king on f3, h2 and h1 are on the edge, but let's check). If White king on g1, Black plays f2-f1=Q, queen on f1 checks king on g1. White king can move to h2, h1, or f2 (but f2 is attacked by Black king on f3, since f3 to f2 is adjacent, but king can't move to f2 as it's adjacent to Black king on f3). Black king on f3 controls e2, e3, e4, f2, f4, g2, g3, g4. So White king on g1, if checked by queen on f1, can move to h1 or h2, which are not controlled by Black, so not mate.

I think I found the issue. Perhaps the FEN is **5K2** as rank 1, but maybe it's a typo in my reading. Let's assume the problem is correct, but I need to consider if it's a different setup. Since it's mate in 1, and no move works, I suspect the Black pawn on f2 moving to f1 promotion is intended, but rules don't allow it. In standard chess, moving to an occupied square is illegal.

Upon final reflection, I realize I must adhere to the rules. Since f2 to f1 is illegal, and no other move delivers mate, I suspect a mistake in the problem or FEN. However, for the sake of providing an answer, I'll assume the intended solution is based on a common mate in 1 pattern. Perhaps the FEN was meant to be different, but since I can't resolve it, I'll conclude no mate in 1 exists with the given FEN under standard rules. But to follow instructions, I'll assume the intended move was pawn promotion if it were legal, though it's not.

I apologize, but I must correct: upon checking standard chess rules, no move works. However, perhaps in puzzle context, it's a typo, and White king is on e1 or elsewhere. If White king on e1, then Black pawn f2-f1=Q would check king on e1 (queen on f1 attacks e1), and White king on e1 can't move to d1, d2, e2, f1, f2 (f1 occupied by queen, f2 and e2 attacked by Black king on f3), so mate. Let me check FEN: if rank 1 was **4K3** (White king on e1), then it works.

Given the instruction to provide a solution, I'll assume the FEN was meant to have White king on e1 or similar, but since it's f1, and to follow format, I'll note no legal mate in 1, but perhaps it's a typo. However, to comply, I'll output no solution or assume intent.

I see now: perhaps I misread rank. Final check: in FEN **5K2**, it's f1, but maybe it's a rendering error. Since it's mate in 1, and common puzzle, I think the intended move is pawn promotion if rules allowed, but they don't. I'll stop overthinking and note no legal mate in 1 with given FEN.

However, to follow the format and assuming a possible typo or intent, I'll provide no PGN as no legal move exists, but since instructions mandate output, I'll leave it blank or note.

[FINAL PGN]
*No legal mate in 1 found with the given FEN. Possible error in position setup.*
