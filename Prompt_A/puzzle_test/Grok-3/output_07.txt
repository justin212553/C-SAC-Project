--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

The position is given by the FEN: 5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1, and the goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move (Mate in 1). Let's analyze the position systematically.

First, I observe the board setup from the FEN:
- White pieces: King on g2, Knight on e4, Rook on g4.
- Black pieces: King on h8, Rook on f8, pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
- It's White's turn to move.

Since it's a Mate in 1, I need to find a single move by White that immediately puts the Black king in checkmate, meaning the Black king is in check and has no legal moves to escape the check (no way to move the king, block the check, or capture the checking piece).

Let's evaluate the position of the Black king on h8. It's on the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to mating patterns, especially in corners. The Black king is surrounded by its own pawns on f7, g7, and h7, which restrict its movement. The potential escape squares for the Black king are g8 (blocked by the g7 pawn) and h7 (blocked by the h7 pawn). Thus, the Black king has no legal moves to escape if put in check, as it is already trapped by its own pieces.

Now, I need to find a White move that delivers check to the Black king. Let's consider the possible moves of White's pieces:
1. **White King on g2**: The king can move to f1, f2, f3, g1, g3, h1, h2, or h3. None of these squares attack the Black king on h8, and moving the king does not contribute to an immediate check. So, king moves are irrelevant for a Mate in 1.
2. **White Knight on e4**: The knight can move to various squares (c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, g5). I need to check if any of these moves deliver a check to the Black king on h8. Calculating the knight's possible attacks:
   - From e4, a knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one perpendicular, or vice versa.
   - Possible squares: c3 (no check), c5 (no check), d2 (no check), d6 (no check), f2 (no check), f6 (no check), g3 (no check), g5 (no check). None of these squares directly attack h8, as a knight on g5 would attack h7 (occupied by a pawn) and f7 (also occupied), but not h8. So, no knight move delivers check.
3. **White Rook on g4**: The rook can move along the g-file (up to g8 or down to g1) or along the 4th rank (to a4 through h4). I need to see if any of these moves put the Black king in check.
   - Moving along the g-file to g8: The square g8 is empty, and moving the rook to g8 (Rg8) places it on the same file as the Black king on h8, but it's not a direct check since the rook on g8 does not attack h8 (rooks attack along ranks and files, not diagonally or adjacent squares unless on the same rank/file).
   - Moving along the 4th rank to h4: The square h4 is empty, and moving the rook to h4 (Rh4) places it on the h-file, directly in line with the Black king on h8. Since there are no pieces between h4 and h8 on the h-file, this move delivers a check (Rh4+).

Now, I verify if Rh4+ is indeed checkmate. With the rook on h4, the Black king on h8 is in check. Let's see if Black has any way to escape:
- **Move the king**: The Black king on h8 can only potentially move to g8 or h7. However, g8 is blocked by the Black pawn on g7, and h7 is occupied by the Black pawn on h7. So, the king cannot move.
- **Block the check**: The check is along the h-file from h4 to h8. To block, Black would need to place a piece between h4 and h8 (on h5, h6, or h7). However, h7 is already occupied by a Black pawn (which can't move to block further), and Black has no other pieces that can move to h5 or h6 (the Black rook on f8 can only move along the 8th rank or f-file, and the pawns on f7 and g7 can't move to the h-file). So, no way to block.
- **Capture the checking piece**: The checking piece is the White rook on h4. No Black piece attacks h4. The Black king can't capture it (not adjacent), the Black rook on f8 doesn't attack h4, and the pawns are too far or immobile in a way that they can't capture on h4. So, no capture is possible.

Since Black has no legal moves to escape the check (cannot move the king, block the check, or capture the rook), the position after Rh4+ is checkmate.

I double-check if there are any other possible Mate in 1 moves. From the earlier analysis, neither the king nor the knight can deliver an immediate check leading to mate. Only the rook move to h4 works. I also confirm the move is legal: the rook on g4 moving to h4 is unobstructed, as the 4th rank from g4 to h4 is empty.

Thus, the solution to this Mate in 1 puzzle is the move Rh4#.
