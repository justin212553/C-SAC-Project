--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: r5k1/2r4p/4pRpP/qP1p4/3Q2P1/5R2/1P6/1K6 w - - 0 1. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 3 moves for White. First, I will visualize the board and identify the key pieces and their potential roles in delivering mate.

Breaking down the FEN:
- White pieces: King on b1, Queen on d4, Rooks on f3 and f6, Pawns on b2, b5, g4, and h6.
- Black pieces: King on g8, Queen on a5, Rooks on a8 and c7, Pawns on d5, e6, and h7.
- White to move.

The objective is mate in 3, so I need a sequence of moves where, no matter how Black responds, White can deliver checkmate on the third move. This suggests looking for a forcing sequence, likely involving checks or threats that limit Black's responses.

### Step 1: Identify Key Threats and Candidate Moves
Looking at the position, White has a strong attacking setup with the Queen on d4, Rooks on f3 and f6, and pawns advanced on g4 and h6 near the Black king. The Black king is on g8, somewhat exposed, with limited escape squares due to White's control over f7 (by the rook on f6) and h7 (by the pawn on h6). The pawn on g4 also supports potential threats on the h-file or g-file.

Key observations:
- The rook on f6 is pinning the e6 pawn to the Black king (since moving e6 would expose the king to a discovered check from the rook on f3).
- The queen on d4 controls many central squares and can potentially swing to the kingside for an attack.
- The h6 pawn is a significant threat, as it can promote or support a mating attack on h7 or g7.
- Black's pieces (queen on a5, rooks on a8 and c7) are mostly on the queenside, far from defending the king.

Candidate moves for White should focus on immediate threats to the Black king, likely involving the queen or rooks to deliver checks or force Black into a vulnerable position. Let’s consider moves that give check or create unavoidable threats.

Possible first moves:
1. Qh8+ (check with the queen, attacking the king directly).
2. Rg3 (moving the rook to g3 to threaten Rh3 and mate on h7).
3. Qg7 (queen to g7, threatening mate on h8 or h7).

### Step 2: Evaluate Candidate Moves
Let’s test these moves systematically to see if they lead to mate in 3.

#### Option 1: 1. Qh8+
- Move: Queen to h8, giving check.
- Black’s response: The king must move. Possible moves are Kh8 (to h8, but that’s where the queen is, so invalid). Wait, let me correct: Qh8+ moves the queen to h8, attacking the king on g8, so the king can move to f7 (only square, since g7 is attacked by the h6 pawn indirectly if the king moves there, but actually g7 is not directly controlled yet).
  - Black king to f7 (Kf7) is the only legal move, as g7 is not attacked yet, but let’s confirm: h6 pawn doesn’t attack g7, so Kf7 is the only escape square (since h7 is controlled by White’s h6 pawn, and f8 is controlled by the rook on f6).
  - After 1. Qh8+ Kf7, White needs to continue the attack. Possible move: 2. Qxh7+ (capturing the h7 pawn with check).
  - Black’s response: King moves to e8 (Ke8, only square, since f6 is controlled by White’s rook).
  - Then 3. Qg8# (queen to g8, checkmate, as Black king on e8 has no escape squares: f7 is controlled by White’s rook on f3, d7 is not possible for king, e7 is blocked by Black’s own pawn on e6, f8 is controlled by White’s rook on f6).
- This seems promising. Sequence: 1. Qh8+ Kf7 2. Qxh7+ Ke8 3. Qg8#. Let me double-check if Black has any other defenses or if I missed something.
- After 1. Qh8+ Kf7, Black has no other moves (king must move, and f7 is the only square). After 2. Qxh7+, king to e8 is forced. After 3. Qg8, king cannot move, and no Black piece can block or capture. Mate confirmed.

I should still check other options to ensure this is the intended solution or if there’s a faster or alternative mate.

#### Option 2: 1. Rg3
- Move: Rook to g3, threatening Rh3 and mate on h7.
- Black can respond in multiple ways, e.g., h5 to block the h-file with the pawn, or move the king, or use other pieces.
  - If 1. Rg3 h5 (pawn to h5 to block), then White can play 2. gxh5, but Black has time to defend, and mate in 3 is not clear.
  - If 1. Rg3 Kf7, then 2. Rh3, but Black can play Ke8 or other moves, and mate is not immediate.
- This line does not seem forcing enough, as Black has multiple responses, and mate in 3 is not guaranteed.

#### Option 3: 1. Qg7
- Move: Queen to g7, threatening Qh8# or Qxh7#.
- Black must respond to prevent mate. Possible moves: h5 (pawn to h5 to give the king an escape), or Kf7.
  - If 1. Qg7 h5, then 2. gxh5, but Black can play Kf7 or other defenses, and mate is not clear in 3.
  - If 1. Qg7 Kf7, then 2. Qxh7+ Ke8, but again, it’s similar to the first line but delayed, and I need to ensure mate in 3.
- This also does not seem as direct as the first option.

### Step 3: Confirm the Best Sequence
Revisiting Option 1 (1. Qh8+), the sequence is:
- 1. Qh8+ Kf7 (forced, only legal move for king, as h7 is controlled by White’s pawn on h6, so king cannot go there, and f8 is controlled by rook on f6).
- 2. Qxh7+ Ke8 (forced, only square, as f6 is controlled by White’s rook, f8 by rook, f7 by other rook after queen moves).
- 3. Qg8# (checkmate, as king on e8 cannot move: f7 controlled by rook on f3, d7 not possible, e7 blocked by own pawn, f8 controlled by rook on f6).

I need to ensure no other Black moves interfere. Black’s other pieces (queen on a5, rooks on a8 and c7) are too far to intervene in this quick sequence. No interpositions or captures are possible to stop the checks.

### Step 4: Verify Legality and Notation
- All moves are legal: Qd4 to h8 is a valid diagonal move, capturing nothing, giving check.
- Qh8 to h7 captures Black’s pawn, giving check.
- Qh7 to g8 is a valid move, delivering mate.
- Black’s king moves are forced as described.

This sequence achieves mate in 3 with no deviations possible for Black to escape.

### Conclusion
The correct sequence for mate in 3 is 1. Qh8+ Kf7 2. Qxh7+ Ke8 3. Qg8#. I will now output this in the required PGN format with appropriate move numbers and notations.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qh8+ Kf7 2. Qxh7+ Ke8 3. Qg8#
