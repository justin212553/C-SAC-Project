--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let me analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 2 moves for Black. Since it's Black to move, I need to identify a sequence where Black's first move forces White into a position where Black can deliver checkmate on the second move, regardless of White's response.

First, let's understand the position. The board setup from the FEN shows:
- Black pieces: King on c2, Rooks on e8 and f7, pawns on c3, d6, and f6.
- White pieces: King on a3, pawns on a2 and b5.
- It's Black's turn to move.

The objective is mate in 2, so Black's first move must create a threat of mate on the next move, and White must have no way to prevent it. I’ll start by assessing the position of the White king on a3. It’s near the edge of the board, which often makes it vulnerable to mating attacks, especially with rooks that can control ranks and files.

Let me consider the mobility of the White king. The White king on a3 can move to a4, b4, or b3 (since a2 is occupied by a White pawn, and b2 is empty). However, Black has a pawn on c3, which restricts some potential escape squares indirectly, and the Black king on c2 is also close, potentially limiting White's king movement further due to opposition rules (kings cannot move to adjacent squares).

Now, Black has two rooks, which are powerful pieces for delivering checkmate, especially against a king on the edge. One rook is on e8 and the other on f7. I can use these rooks to control key ranks or files to trap the White king. A common mating pattern with two rooks is to force the enemy king to the edge of the board and then deliver a check from which there is no escape. Since the White king is already on the a-file, near the edge, I might be able to use the rooks to cut off escape squares.

Let me try a candidate move for Black. One idea is to move the rook on f7 to f3, attacking the White king along the third rank. So, 1...Rf3. Now, the White king is in check. White must respond to this check. The possible moves for the White king are:
- Ka4 (moving up to the fourth rank),
- Kb4 (moving diagonally up),
- Kb3 (moving down towards the Black king, but still on the a-file it's b3).

If White plays Ka4, the king moves to a4. Now, Black needs to deliver mate. I can move the other rook from e8 to a8, so 2...Ra8#. This would be checkmate because the White king on a4 is attacked by the rook on a8, and the escape squares are blocked: a5 is not attacked but the king can't move there because it's still in check from the rook on f3 controlling the rank (wait, no, f3 rook is on the third rank, so it doesn't control a4's rank). I miscalculated. The rook on f3 is on the third rank, so if the White king is on a4 (fourth rank), the rook on f3 does not attack it. My apologies, I made an error in visualization.

Let me correct this. If Black plays 1...Rf3, White king is on a3, so rook on f3 attacks a3 along the third rank, so it's check. White king moves to Ka4 (a4 is on the fourth rank), so the rook on f3 no longer attacks it because f3 is third rank. So after Ka4, it's not check anymore. Then Black plays 2...Ra8, placing the rook on a8, which attacks a4 along the a-file, so it's check. Now, does White have escape squares? From a4, the king can move to a5, b5, or b4. Wait, b5 has a White pawn, so it's blocked. So possible moves are a5 or b4. Neither a5 nor b4 is attacked by Black pieces after 2...Ra8, because the rook on f3 is on the third rank, not controlling a5 or b4. So the king can escape to a5 or b4, meaning it's not checkmate. So 1...Rf3 doesn't work.

Let me try another move. What if I move the rook from e8 to a8 directly? So 1...Ra8. This places the rook on the a-file, attacking the White king on a3. So it's check. White must respond. Possible moves for the White king are:
- Kb4 (to the b-file, fourth rank),
- Kb3 (to b3),
- Ka4 (to a4, but a4 is still on the a-file, so still in check from Ra8).

If White plays Ka4, the king moves to a4, but the rook on a8 still attacks along the a-file, so it's still check, and actually, the king can't stay on the a-file. I think I misread; moving to a4 or a2 is illegal because the rook on a8 controls the entire a-file, so the only legal moves are Kb4 or Kb3, moving off the a-file.

So, if White plays Kb4, the king is on b4. Now Black needs to deliver mate on the second move. I have the other rook on f7. Can I use it to attack b4? If I move the rook to f4 (2...Rf4), it attacks along the fourth rank, so it checks the king on b4. Now, check the escape squares for the White king on b4: possible moves are a5, b5, c5, a4, c4, a3, b3, c3. But b5 is occupied by White's pawn, c3 is occupied by Black's pawn, and c4 and c5 are potentially controlled by the Black king on c2 (king opposition prevents moving to adjacent squares). Let's verify:
- a5: not attacked by Black pieces.
- b5: blocked by White pawn.
- c5: king can't move to c5 because Black king is on c2 (adjacent square, illegal).
- a4: not attacked.
- c4: illegal due to Black king on c2.
- a3: not attacked.
- b3: not attacked.
- c3: blocked by Black pawn.

After 2...Rf4, the rook on f4 attacks b4, so it's check. But the king can escape to a5, a4, a3, or b3, none of which are controlled by Black pieces (the rook on a8 controls the a-file, but after king moves to b4, a8 rook no longer attacks it directly unless it moves back to a-file). If king moves to a5 after 2...Rf4, it's on a5, and rook on a8 attacks a5 along the a-file, so it's still check. Similarly, if king moves to a4 or a3, it's still on the a-file, so rook on a8 attacks it. Let's list properly:
- From b4, if checked by Rf4 (rook on f4 attacking along fourth rank), escape squares are:
  - a5: but a5 is on a-file, controlled by Ra8, so still check.
  - b5: blocked.
  - c5: illegal (adjacent to Black king on c2).
  - a4: on a-file, controlled by Ra8, still check.
  - c4: illegal (adjacent to Black king).
  - a3: on a-file, controlled by Ra8, still check.
  - b3: not on a-file, not on fourth rank, so not attacked by Rf4 or Ra8.
  - c3: blocked by Black pawn.

So, the king can move to b3, which is not attacked by either rook (Ra8 controls a-file, Rf4 controls fourth rank, b3 is neither). So after 2...Rf4, White can play Kb3, escaping check, so it's not mate.

I need a better second move for Black after 1...Ra8 and White's Kb4. Instead of Rf4, can I move the rook to b7 or something to attack b4? If 2...Rb7, rook moves to b7, attacking b4 along the b-file. Now, White king on b4 is in check from Rb7. Escape squares:
- a5: attacked by Ra8 (a-file).
- b5: blocked.
- c5: illegal (Black king on c2).
- a4: attacked by Ra8.
- c4: illegal.
- a3: attacked by Ra8.
- b3: not attacked by Rb7 (b7 attacks b-file, but only b4 since king moved, wait no, b7 rook attacks entire b-file, so b3 is attacked).
- c3: blocked.

I miscalculated again. Rook on b7 attacks the entire b-file, so b3 is attacked by Rb7. So if king moves to b3, it's still check from Rb7. All other squares (a5, a4, a3) are attacked by Ra8, and c5, c4 are illegal, b5 and c3 blocked. So no legal moves for White king if Black plays 2...Rb7 after White's Kb4. That seems like mate.

Let me double-check. Position after 1...Ra8, White plays Kb4, Black plays 2...Rb7:
- White king on b4.
- Black rook on a8 (attacks a-file: a1 to a8).
- Black rook on b7 (attacks b-file: b1 to b8, and seventh rank, but for king on b4, it's the b-file attack).
- So king on b4 is attacked by Rb7 along b-file.
- Escape squares:
  - a5: attacked by Ra8.
  - b5: blocked by White pawn.
  - c5: illegal (Black king on c2).
  - a4: attacked by Ra8.
  - c4: illegal.
  - a3: attacked by Ra8.
  - b3: attacked by Rb7 (b-file).
  - c3: blocked by Black pawn.

No legal moves for White king. So it's checkmate.

Now, I need to check the other possible response for White after 1...Ra8. If White plays Kb3 instead of Kb4:
- White king moves to b3.
- Now Black needs to deliver mate. Can I move the rook from f7 to b7 again? 2...Rb7, rook on b7 attacks b-file, so attacks b3, it's check.
- White king on b3, escape squares:
  - a4: attacked by Ra8.
  - b4: attacked by Rb7.
  - c4: illegal (Black king on c2).
  - a3: attacked by Ra8.
  - b2: not attacked by Rb7 (b-file, yes, Rb7 attacks b2), wait, Rb7 is on b7, attacks entire b-file, so b2 is attacked.
  - c3: blocked by Black pawn.
  - a2: blocked by White pawn.
  - c2: illegal (Black king on c2).

I see, b2 is on b-file, so Rb7 attacks b2. So all possible squares:
- a4: attacked by Ra8.
- b4: attacked by Rb7.
- c4: illegal.
- a3: attacked by Ra8.
- b2: attacked by Rb7.
- c3: blocked.
- a2: blocked.
- c2: illegal.

No legal moves. So it's checkmate.

I thought b2 was not attacked, but since Rb7 is on b7, it controls the entire b-file (b1 to b8), so b2 is attacked. Therefore, after 1...Ra8, if White plays Kb3, then 2...Rb7# is checkmate.

Similarly, if White plays Kb4, 2...Rb7# is checkmate.

I confirmed both possible moves for White (Kb4 and Kb3) after 1...Ra8 lead to mate with 2...Rb7#. I thought earlier there might be an issue, but my recheck shows all escape squares are covered or blocked.

I note that in the initial position, White has a pawn on b5, which I accounted for as blocking b5 square, and Black pawn on c3 blocking c3, and Black king on c2 preventing moves to adjacent squares.

So the sequence seems to work: 1...Ra8+ (check), then White has two options, Kb4 or Kb3, and in both cases, 2...Rb7# delivers mate because the rooks control the b-file and a-file, trapping the king with no escape due to blocked squares and the Black king's position.

I consider if White has any other moves or if I missed something. White has a pawn on a2, but moving it doesn't block the check from Ra8, since pawn moves don't interfere with the a-file attack from a8 to a3. Similarly, pawn on b5 can't move to block the check. So only king moves are possible, and both lead to mate as shown.

Therefore, the solution is 1...Ra8+ followed by 2...Rb7#.

I ensure the notation is correct. Black's first move is Ra8, which is check, so Ra8+, and second move Rb7 is checkmate, so Rb7#.

This completes the analysis, and I believe this is the correct mate in 2 sequence.

1... Ra8+ 2. Kb4 Rb7#
