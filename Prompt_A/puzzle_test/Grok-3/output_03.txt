--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1**. The goal is to find a forced checkmate in 1 move, meaning White must deliver checkmate immediately with their next move.

First, let's break down the position:
- White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5.
- Black has a king on g8 and pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
- It's White's turn to move.

Since it's a mate in 1, I need to find a move for White that puts the Black king in check with no legal way for Black to escape. This means the move must either attack the Black king directly or control all possible escape squares while delivering check.

Let's consider the pieces White can move:
1. **White King on b4**: The king can move to adjacent squares (a3, a4, a5, b3, b5, c3, c4, c5). However, moving the king cannot deliver check to the Black king on g8, as the king is too far away and cannot attack across the board in one move. So, king moves are unlikely to result in checkmate.
2. **White Rook on e5**: The rook is a powerful piece that can control ranks and files. From e5, it can move along the e-file (to e1 through e8, except e5 itself) or along the 5th rank (to a5 through h5, except e5 itself). I need to see if moving the rook can deliver check to the Black king on g8.

Now, let's evaluate possible rook moves for check:
- Moving the rook along the e-file to e8 (Re8) places it on the 8th rank, two squares away from the Black king on g8. This move would deliver check because the rook attacks along the rank, and the Black king is on the same rank (8th rank) with no pieces in between.
- I need to confirm if the Black king has any escape squares after Re8+. The Black king on g8 can potentially move to f8 or h8 (since g7 and h7 are blocked by Black's own pawns, and moving to the 7th rank is not possible due to the pawns on f7, g7, h7). However:
  - f8 is attacked by the rook on e8 (since the rook controls the entire 8th rank to the left).
  - h8 is also attacked by the rook on e8 (since the rook controls the entire 8th rank to the right).
  - There are no other squares the king can move to because the pawns block g7, f7, and h7, and the king cannot move to the 9th rank (out of bounds).
- Additionally, Black has no pieces that can block the check (the pawns cannot move to the 8th rank in one move to block the rook's attack), and Black cannot capture the rook since no Black piece can reach e8.

Thus, moving the rook to e8 (Re8+) delivers check, and the Black king has no legal moves to escape, nor can Black block or capture the checking piece. This is checkmate.

To ensure I haven't missed anything, let's quickly check other rook moves:
- Moving the rook to other squares on the e-file (e.g., e6, e7) does not deliver check because the Black king is on g8, and the rook would not be attacking along the same rank or file as the king.
- Moving the rook along the 5th rank (e.g., to f5, g5, h5, or a5, b5, c5, d5) does not deliver check because the rook would not be on the same rank or file as the Black king, and there is no direct attack.

Similarly, as previously concluded, moving the White king does not deliver check or contribute to an immediate mate.

Therefore, the only move that achieves checkmate in 1 is moving the rook from e5 to e8, denoted as Re8#.
