To solve this Mate in 3 problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 b - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position:**
   - The FEN indicates it's Black's turn to move.
   - The material is quite unbalanced, but we see Black has a significant advantage in material, suggesting a potential for a strong attack.
   - The Black king is on a5, and it's relatively exposed but also somewhat difficult to approach directly due to the presence of other pieces on the board.
   - White's king is on a2, which is also somewhat exposed.

2. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The task is to find a checkmate in 3 moves. This means we need to look for a sequence where Black's moves are forcing, leading to a checkmate on the third move.
   - The Black pieces are fairly active, with a queen on f3, a rook on c1, a bishop on b1 (potentially pinned but not necessarily), and a pawn on e4, which controls some central space.

3. **Analyzing Potential Moves:**
   - The Black queen on f3 is already putting pressure on the White position, particularly on the f2 square and indirectly along the f-file.
   - The White king is on a2, and the White queen is on h2, somewhat defending it but also somewhat limited in mobility.
   - A potential weakness for White is the positioning of their king and the relative lack of defenders around it.

4. **Exploring Checkmate Patterns:**
   - To checkmate in 3 moves, we need to start with a strong move that either directly threatens the White king or sets up a subsequent threat that cannot be defended.
   - One potential checkmate pattern involves using the Black queen and rook to coordinate an attack on the White king.

5. **Specific Move Analysis:**
   - Let's examine potential first moves:
     - **1... Qxf2+** is an interesting move because it checks the White king directly. 
     - The White king can move to a1 or b1. If it moves to a1, **2... Rc2** could be a strong follow-up, putting the rook in a more active position and potentially setting up for a checkmate or a strong attack.
     - If White plays **2. Kb1** after **1... Qxf2+**, then **2... Qe2+** could follow, putting pressure on the White position.

6. **Detailed Sequence:**
   - Let's analyze the sequence starting with **1... Qxf2+**.
     - **1... Qxf2+ 2. Kb1 (or Ka1)** is the initial response. 
     - If **2. Ka1**, then **2... Rc2** is a strong move, threatening to penetrate further.
     - If **2. Kb1**, then **2... Qe2+ 3. Ka1 (or Kc1)** could be followed by a decisive move.

7. **Exact Sequence:**
   - **1... Qxf2+ 2. Kb1 Qe2+ 3. Ka1 Rc2#** is a potential checkmate sequence.
     - After **1... Qxf2+**, White is forced to play **2. Kb1** to avoid immediate loss.
     - Then, **2... Qe2+** forces **3. Ka1**.
     - Finally, **3... Rc2#** checkmates White.

Let's verify the sequence and ensure it's the correct PGN.
