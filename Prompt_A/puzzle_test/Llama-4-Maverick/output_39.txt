To solve this checkmate in 4, let's first understand the given position and the pieces involved.

The FEN **r1b1kb1r/1p1nnppp/4p3/1N1p2BP/3N4/2P3Q1/Pq3PP1/R3K2R w - - 0 1** gives us the current state of the board. We can break it down as follows:
- White has a Queen on g3, Knights on b5 and d4, a Bishop on g5, pawns on c3, f2, and g2, and a King on e1, with castling rights for both sides.
- Black has a Queen on b2, Knights on d7 and e7, a Bishop on c8, a King on e8, pawns on b7, c7, d5, e6, f7, g7, and h7, and a Rook on a8 and h8.

First, we need to assess the position:
1. **Material and Development**: White is slightly behind in material but has a significant developmental advantage and a strong attacking position, particularly with the Queen and Knights developed.
2. **King Safety**: Black's King is somewhat exposed in the center, and White's pieces are well-placed to potentially attack it.
3. **Key Pieces and Weaknesses**: The White Knights are well-placed, especially the one on b5, which could potentially jump to c7 or d6. The Bishop on g5 is also pinning a Knight, which could be significant.

Let's analyze potential moves:
- The White Queen is on g3, a good attacking position. It can potentially move to g7 or other squares to put pressure on Black.
- The Knights are well-placed for attacking d7 and potentially forking or pinning other pieces.
- The Bishop on g5 is pinning the Knight on e7, which is a significant weakness for Black.

To achieve checkmate in 4 moves, we need to look for a sequence that:
1. Puts pressure on the Black King.
2. Forces Black's responses.
3. Ultimately checkmates the King.

Let's consider the moves:
1. **Qg7**: This move puts the Queen in a strong attacking position, potentially forcing Black to respond with a move that defends against the check or captures the Queen. However, we need to verify if it's checkmate in 4.

Let's start with the initial analysis:
1. Qg7 is a potential starting move because it directly attacks the Black position and puts pressure on f7 and e7.

Let's verify the sequence:
1. Qg7 Nxg7 (Forced to capture the Queen or move the Knight to avoid losing material or being checkmated)
2. The next move should continue the attack.

Let's directly analyze the given position with the thought process:
1. Qg7 Nxg7
2. Nf5 (This move starts to put pressure and prepares for further attacks. It's a strong move as it develops and attacks.)
   - However, we need to check the actual best move and sequence.

Upon detailed analysis, a potential checkmate sequence could be:
1. Qg7 Nxg7
2. Nf5 exf5
3. Bh6 (or another strong move, but let's verify the exact sequence)

Let's directly check the most promising sequence:
1. Qg7 Nxg7
2. Nf5 exf5
3. Bh6 f6
4. Bxf8#

Let's verify the legality and correctness of this sequence.

The starting position is: **r1b1kb1r/1p1nnppp/4p3/1N1p2BP/3N4/2P3Q1/Pq3PP1/R3K2R w - - 0 1**

Let's apply the moves:
1. Qg7 Nxg7
2. Nf5 exf5
3. Bh6 f6
4. Bxf8#

This sequence appears to be a checkmate.
