To solve this chess puzzle, we first need to understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is given in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) as **5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1**. Let's decode this:

- The position is: Black King on f8, White King on h8, Black Queen on g7, Black Knight on f7, and Black Bishop on g6.
- It's Black's turn to move.
- There are no castling rights available for either side.
- There is no en passant square.
- The half-move clock is 0, indicating no pawn moves or captures have been made recently.
- The full move number is 1, indicating the start of the game or a fresh position for analysis.

The task is to find a Mate in 1, meaning we need to checkmate White in one move.

Let's analyze the position:
1. **Black's Pieces**: The Black King is on f8, the Queen is on g7, the Knight is on f7, and the Bishop is on g6. 
2. **White's Pieces**: The White King is on h8.

Given the material, Black has a significant advantage. The White King is exposed on h8 with no defenders other than itself. 

To checkmate White, we need to put the White King in a position where it is in check and cannot escape the check.

Let's examine potential checks:
- The Black Queen on g7 can potentially check the White King on h8.
- The Black Knight on f7 is already attacking h8, so if the Queen moves away, it could potentially checkmate if the Queen's move also checks or if it directly checkmates.

The most straightforward checkmate would involve the Black Queen moving to a position that checks the White King and is not capturable by any White piece (since there are no other White pieces on the board).

The move **1...Qg8#** is a potential checkmate because it puts the Queen on g8, checking the King on h8, and it's not capturable by any White piece. The King cannot capture the Queen because it's too far away and blocked by the Knight on f7.

Let's verify if this move is legal and leads to checkmate:
- The Queen moves from g7 to g8, putting the White King in check.
- The White King on h8 cannot capture the Queen.
- There are no other White pieces to capture the Queen or interpose.
- The King cannot move to a safe square.

Thus, **1...Qg8#** is a valid checkmate.
