To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task. The position is given in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) as **8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1**. This notation describes the position of the pieces on the board. Let's decode it:

- The rows are described from the 8th rank to the 1st rank.
- "8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1" tells us:
  - The 8th, 7th, and 6th ranks are empty.
  - On the 5th rank, there's a black king on the b-file and empty squares elsewhere on that rank except for the king.
  - On the 4th rank, there's a black rook on the e-file.
  - The 3rd rank is empty.
  - On the 2nd rank, there are white pawns on f, g, and h files.
  - On the 1st rank, there's a white king on g-file.

So, the position is: Black king is on b5, Black rook is on e4, White king is on g1, and White pawns are on f2, g2, and h2.

The task is to find a Mate in 1 (checkmate in one move) with Black.

Let's analyze:
1. **Current Position**: Black king on b5, Black rook on e4, White king on g1, White pawns on f2, g2, h2.
2. **Black's Turn**: We need to find a checkmate for Black.
3. **Checking White's King**: The White king is on g1. To checkmate, we need to put it in a position where it's in check and cannot escape the check.

The Black rook on e4 can potentially check the White king if it moves to g4 or e1. Let's examine these moves:
- **1...Re1#**: If the Black rook moves to e1, it puts the White king in check. The White king cannot capture the rook because it's too far away and there's no other White piece that can interpose. Thus, Re1 is checkmate because the king is in check and cannot escape the check.

Let's verify if there are other possible checkmates:
- **1...Rg4+**: This move checks the White king, but it's not checkmate because the White king can move to f1 or h1.

Therefore, the only move that leads to checkmate is **1...Re1#**.
