To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the FEN**: The FEN notation gives us the current state of the board. Here, it's black to move. Let's decode it:
   - **k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8**: This part describes the pieces on the board. 'k' is the black king, 'p' are black pawns, 'b' is a black bishop, 'K' is the white king, and 'r' is a black rook. The numbers represent empty squares.
   - 'b - - 0 1': Indicates it's black's turn to move ('b'), there are no en passant captures available ('-'), no half-move clock for the fifty-move rule ('-'), and it's the first move of the current turn ('0 1').

2. **Analyzing the Position**:
   - The black king is on a8, and the white king is on a3. 
   - The black rook is on h2, potentially threatening the white king or supporting a checkmate.
   - The black bishop on b5 is somewhat restricted but could be part of a checkmate pattern.
   - Black has pawns on b5, c4, and c5, which could potentially be used to block checks or support a checkmate.

3. **Checking for Checkmate**:
   - To achieve checkmate, we need to put the white king in a position where it is in check and cannot escape the check.
   - The white king is on a3, so we need to look for a check that it cannot defend against or escape from.

4. **Potential Checkmate Patterns**:
   - The black king is on a8, which is quite far from the white king. However, the black rook on h2 is relatively close to the white king and is a potential piece to deliver checkmate or support a checkmate pattern.
   - The white king is somewhat exposed on a3, with no pieces nearby to defend it, making it a potential target.

5. **Examining Possible Moves**:
   - The black rook on h2 can potentially move to a2, putting it in a position to potentially check the white king. If the rook moves to a2, it gives check (Ra2+). The white king cannot capture the rook because it's too far away and potentially pinned by other black pieces or the edge of the board. The king can try to escape to b3 or b2, but the check could be checkmate if there's no legal move.
   - Let's check if Ra2 is checkmate: If ...Rh2-a2+, Ka3-b3 is not possible because the king is going into check from the rook and there are no interpositions or captures available for white. However, we need to verify the exact position.

6. **Verifying the Move**:
   - The move Rh2-a2+ is indeed check. The white king on a3 can try moving to b3. However, upon closer inspection, Kb3 is not a valid response because it's still in check from the rook, and there are no other white pieces to interpose. The king cannot go to a2 because it's occupied by the black rook, and a4 is not a valid move as it's not adjacent. The white king cannot capture the rook as it's on a2, directly in front of it.
   - Upon checking, the white king can't escape the check from Ra2+, making it checkmate.

7. **PGN Notation**:
   - The move is 1...Ra2#. 

Let's directly output the solution as per the instructions.
