To solve this Mate in 1 problem, we start by analyzing the given FEN: **8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1**. This FEN indicates the current state of the board.

1. **Understanding the FEN**: The FEN string tells us the position of the pieces on the board. Here, it's black to move, and we are looking for a checkmate in one move. The position is: Black King on g7, Black Knight on e5, Black Rook on g5; White King on g1, White Rooks on f1 and h1, White Pawns on f2, g2, and h2.

2. **Analyzing the Position**: The black king is on g7, and it's black's turn. We need to find a move that puts the white king in checkmate.

3. **Checking Possible Moves**: 
   - The black king can move to f6, f7, f8, h6, h7, or h8. We need to check if any of these moves result in checkmate, but given it's black's turn and we're looking for a checkmate, we're actually looking for a move that already puts the white king in checkmate.
   - The black knight on e5 can potentially move to c4, c6, d3, d7, f3, f7, g4, or g6. We need to check if any of these moves attack the white king.
   - The black rook on g5 can move along the g-file or along the 5th rank. It can potentially check or checkmate the white king if it's not blocked and if the king is on the same rank or file.

4. **Inspecting the White King's Position**: The white king is on g1. For it to be checkmated, a black piece must be able to attack it. The white king is somewhat safe with its rooks potentially protecting it, but here, the black rook on g5 is already on the same file as the white king and is not blocked by any other piece on the g-file.

5. **Identifying the Checkmate**: 
   - The black rook on g5 can potentially checkmate the white king if it moves to g1 (Rxg1#), since the white king is on g1 and there's no piece intervening on the g-file that would prevent this.

6. **Verifying the Move**: 
   - The move Rxg1# is a legal move because the black rook can capture on g1, and it results in checkmate because the white king is on g1 and cannot escape capture or be blocked by other white pieces.

7. **PGN Notation**: The move is made by the black rook capturing on g1 and checkmating the white king. In PGN notation, this is represented as "Rxg1#".

Since it's black's turn, and this is the first move, we simply need to notate the checkmating move.
