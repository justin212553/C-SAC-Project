To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is defined by the FEN: **4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R b - - 0 1**. We need to find a forced checkmate in 4 moves.

First, let's decode the FEN to understand the position:
- The board is: 
  - Black King on g8, Rook on e8, Bishop on c5, Knight on e4, Knight on g4, Bishop on a6, Pawns on a7, f7, g7, h7.
  - White King on c1, Queen on d2, Knight on f3, Bishop on d1 (though the FEN suggests a Rook on a1 and a King on c1, and a Bishop is not directly indicated, it seems there's a slight misinterpretation; correctly, it should be understood as: Rook on a1, King on c1, and the rest accordingly), Pawns on b2, c2, d5, f2, g2, h2.

Given the task is to find a Mate in 4, we start by analyzing the position:

1. **Assessing the Position**: Black is to move. The black knights are actively placed, and there's a potential threat against the white king. The white king is somewhat exposed on c1, with the potential for it to be targeted.

2. **Identifying Candidate Moves**: The first move should aim at exploiting the weaknesses around the white king or creating a strong threat. 

3. **Analyzing Moves**:
   - The black knights are well-placed. One potential move is to use the knights or other pieces to create a threat.
   - The presence of the black bishop on c5 and the rook on e8 suggests potential for a strong attack down the e-file or using the bishop to pin or attack.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:
- **1...Nxf2**: This move attacks the white position and could potentially weaken their structure, but we need to see if it leads to a forced checkmate.
- Other moves like **1...Re1#** seem like an immediate checkmate, but let's verify if it's possible and if it's the start of a Mate in 4 sequence.

Let's directly examine the position and potential moves:
- The black pieces are actively placed, and there's an immediate threat that can be executed.

Upon closer inspection:
- **1... Re1+** is a check that forces **2. Kd2**. Then, **2... Nxf2** can be played, attacking the white queen and developing a strong threat. However, we need to verify the subsequent moves.

Let's directly check the sequence:
1. **1... Re1+**
2. **2. Kd2 Nxf2**
3. **3. Qxf2 (or other moves, but this seems like a reasonable response) Nd4+**
   - If white plays **3. Ke3**, then **3... Nd4** (or other moves) could follow, but let's check a more forcing line.
4. Upon **3. Qxf2**, **3... Nd4+** is a strong move, and then **4. Kc1 Ne2#** is checkmate.

Let's verify the sequence and directly provide the PGN.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Re1+ 2. Kd2 Nxf2 3. Qxf2 Nd4+ 4. Kc1 Ne2#
