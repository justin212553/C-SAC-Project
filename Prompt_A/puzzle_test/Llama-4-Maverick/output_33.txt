To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is given in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) as **bn2k3/2R2r2/1p1p4/3N2BB/4P3/2P3PP/r4r2/R3n2K w - - 0 1**, and we need to find a forced checkmate in 4 moves.

First, let's decode the FEN notation:
- **bn2k3/2R2r2/1p1p4/3N2BB/4P3/2P3PP/r4r2/R3n2K**: This is the position on the board.
  - The first part describes the position from White's perspective, row by row, starting from the top (8th row for Black, 1st row for White).
  - 'b' or 'w' denotes a Black or White piece (b for bishop, w not used as it's White to move, r for rook, n for knight, k for king, p or P for pawn, q or Q for queen).
  - '1' denotes an empty square.
- **w**: It's White's turn to move.
- **-**: There's no en passant square.
- **-**: The number of moves since the last pawn move or capture (for the 50-move rule).
- **0 1**: The halfmove clock and the fullmove number, indicating the game has just started (1st move for White).

Let's analyze the given position:
- White is to move.
- The position is: Black has a knight on e8, a bishop on b8, a king on e7 (though it seems like it should be on a more reasonable square, given the FEN, it's actually on e7), a pawn on b6, pawns or pieces on d6, a White Rook on c7, a Black rook on f7, a White Knight on d5, White Bishops on d5 and g5 (this is a bit of a problem as there's a White Knight on d5, so one of the Bishops must be on a different square, likely g5), a White Pawn on e4, White pawns on c3 and g3 and h3, Black Rooks on f2 and a2, a Black Knight on e1, and a White Rook on a1, with the White King on h1.

First, let's correct and simplify the understanding of the position:
- The Black King is on e7.
- There's a White Rook on c7, which is somewhat exposed but also putting pressure.
- The White Knight is on d5.
- One White Bishop is on g5 (the other might be on h4 or another plausible square, but given the FEN, it's likely one is on g5 and the other on a more plausible square like h4 isn't available; let's assume the FEN implies a Bishop on g5 and potentially another on a square like b5 isn't available due to the pawn on b6, so possibly on a4 or another square).

To achieve checkmate in 4 moves, we need to look for:
1. Checks or threats that can be made with White pieces.
2. Potential weaknesses around the Black King.
3. Ways to develop an attack or utilize the existing pieces effectively.

Let's start by examining the pieces:
- The White Knight on d5 is quite active.
- The White Rook on c7 is somewhat active but needs support.
- The White Bishops are potentially very active, especially if one is on g5, putting pressure on the Black position.

The Black King is on e7, and it's somewhat exposed. The goal is to exploit this exposure.

Let's analyze potential moves:
1. **Nf6+** or other Knight moves could be a starting point, but let's check the actual position and plausible moves.

Given the FEN, let's directly analyze plausible checkmating sequences.

1. The first move should ideally be a check or a strong threat.
2. We need to calculate the variations and responses.

Let's directly examine potential first moves and their consequences.

One potential sequence starts with **1. Bg6+**, aiming to put the Black King in a difficult position.

Let's analyze:
1. **1. Bg6+** (if we assume one Bishop is on g5 and can move or another plausible Bishop move) **Ke6** (or other moves, but this seems like a plausible response) **2. Nf4+** (continuing the check and attack) **Kf6** (or other moves) **3. Be5+** (continuing with checks) **Ke6** (or other plausible moves) and then look for a checkmate.

However, let's directly find a plausible sequence:
1. The actual position suggests that **1. RxRf7+ KxR7 (or other captures)** could be a start, but let's directly check a plausible sequence.

Let's directly analyze and provide a potential solution.

After detailed analysis, here's the thought process condensed:
The position suggests a complex but potentially winning position for White due to the exposed Black King and the active White pieces.

Let's directly provide the solution.
