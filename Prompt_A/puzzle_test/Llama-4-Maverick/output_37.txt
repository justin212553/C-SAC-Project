To solve this checkmate in 4, let's first analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **r1bk3r/pppq1ppp/5n2/4N1N1/2Bp4/Bn6/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 1**.

1. **Assess the Position**: The white king is on g1, and it's white's turn. The position is sharp, with several pieces developed on both sides. White has a significant presence in the center and on the kingside with knights on e5 and g5. The black king is on c8, somewhat exposed but behind other pieces.

2. **Identify Key Pieces and Threats**: 
   - White has knights on e5 and g5, which are well-placed and potentially threatening to black's position.
   - The white bishop on c4 is also a key piece, putting pressure on the f7 square and potentially other squares along the diagonal.
   - Black's king is somewhat exposed on c8, and the presence of white's knights and bishop suggests potential for a mating attack.

3. **Analyze Potential Moves**:
   - The white knights are in an excellent position to potentially deliver checkmate or participate in a mating sequence.
   - The move Nf7 is a potential candidate as it attacks the black king directly and could be part of a mating sequence.
   - Other pieces like the bishop on c4 and the knight on g5 could also play a role in the mating attack.

4. **Consider Forced Responses**:
   - Any potential checkmate sequence must consider black's possible responses and ensure they are forced moves.

Let's directly analyze potential checkmate sequences:
1. **Nf7**: This move directly attacks the black king and could be a starting point. After Nf7, black's responses are limited due to the check.

Let's start with the move **1. Nf7**:
- **1... Kd7** (Forced to get out of check)
- Then, white can play **2. Ne7**, putting the other knight in a strong position and potentially setting up for further attacks.

Continuing from here:
- **2... Qc7** (Trying to develop and defend)
- **3. Bb5+** (Check, forcing black to respond)
- **3... Kc8**
- **4. Nd6#** (Checkmate)

Let's verify the sequence:
1. Nf7 Kd7
2. Ne7 Qc7
3. Bb5+ Kc8
4. Nd6#

Now, let's format this as PGN.
