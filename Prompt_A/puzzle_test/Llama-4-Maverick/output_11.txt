To solve this Mate in 2 problem, we start by analyzing the given FEN: **7r/8/2KQ4/3B4/8/r4R2/7r/4b1nk w - - 0 1**. The first step is to understand the position on the board.

1. **Understanding the Position:**
   - White: King on c6, Queen on d6, Bishop on d5, Rook on f3.
   - Black: King on g1, Bishop on e1, Rook on a3, Rook on h8, Rook on h2.

2. **Assessing the Goal:**
   - We need to find a checkmate in 2 moves.

3. **Initial Observations:**
   - The Black King is on g1, and it's somewhat exposed but supported by other pieces.
   - White has a significant material presence and a potentially strong attacking setup.

4. **Analyzing White's Pieces and Potential Moves:**
   - The White Queen on d6 is quite active and can potentially move to various squares.
   - The Bishop on d5 is somewhat limited by its position but controls some important diagonals.
   - The Rook on f3 is well-placed to potentially participate in an attack on the Black King or its surrounding pieces.

5. **Checking for Immediate Threats and Potential Checks:**
   - The White Queen can potentially check the Black King. Let's examine possible checks and their consequences.

6. **Exploring Potential First Moves:**
   - One potential check is Qg3+, which would put the Queen in a position to potentially checkmate or force a response that could be followed up by a checkmate.

7. **Analyzing Qg3+:**
   - If 1. Qg3+, then Black's King can move to h1. The response to Kh1 could be Rf1#, as the Rook on f3 can move to f1 to checkmate.

8. **Checking for Other Black Responses to Qg3+:**
   - After Qg3+, Black could also play Bxg3, but this would be met with Rxg3#, as the Rook on f3 can capture the Bishop and checkmate the King.

9. **Verifying the Move Order and Checking for Alternatives:**
   - The sequence appears to be 1. Qg3+ Kh1 (or Bxg3) 2. Rf1# (or Rxg3#).

10. **Confirming the PGN:**
    Let's put the moves together.

1. Qg3+ Kh1
2. Rf1#

Let's format this according to the PGN specification.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qd6g3+ Kg1h1 2. Rf3f1#
