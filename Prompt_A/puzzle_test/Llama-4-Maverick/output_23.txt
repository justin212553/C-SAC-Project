To solve this Mate in 3 problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **r4r1k/p5Rp/1p3pb1/2P4N/2B5/P7/6PP/B2n2K1 w - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position:**
   - The FEN indicates it's White's turn to move.
   - The position of the pieces is as follows: White has a King on f1, a Knight on h5, a Bishop on c4, a Pawn on c5, a Pawn on a3, a Pawn on g2, a Pawn on h2, and a Rook on g7. Black has a King on h8, a Rook on f8, a Rook on e8, a Bishop on g6, a Pawn on b6, a Pawn on a7, and a Knight on d1.

2. **Assessing the Position:**
   - The White King is somewhat exposed on f1, but it's not in immediate danger.
   - White has a significant material presence on the board, with a Rook on g7 putting pressure on Black's position.
   - Black's King is somewhat exposed on h8, with the White Rook on g7 already exerting pressure.

3. **Looking for Checkmate Patterns:**
   - The task is to find a checkmate in 3 moves. The first move should ideally put Black in a difficult position or limit their responses significantly.
   - The presence of the White Rook on g7 and the Knight on h5 suggests potential mating patterns involving these pieces.

4. **Analyzing Potential First Moves:**
   - One potential first move is **1. Rxg6**, aiming to weaken Black's position and potentially create a mating opportunity. However, we need to verify if it leads to a checkmate in 3.
   - Let's consider the response to **1. Rxg6**: Black can respond with **1... hxg6**. Then, we need a strong follow-up.

5. **Exploring the Sequence:**
   - After **1. Rxg6 hxg6**, we can play **2. Nf6**, putting the Knight in a strong position and potentially setting up for a checkmate or forcing Black into a difficult spot.
   - Upon **2... Rxf6** (trying to remove the Knight), White can play **3. Rh7#**, checkmating Black.

6. **Checking the Sequence:**
   - Let's verify: **1. Rxg6 hxg6; 2. Nf6 Rxf6; 3. Rh7#**. This sequence appears to be a valid checkmate in 3.

7. **PGN Notation:**
   - The move sequence in PGN format, with proper notation for checkmate, is required.

Let's directly analyze and provide the PGN:

The initial thought process leads to the sequence starting with **1. Rxg6**. Let's directly check the validity and provide the PGN.
