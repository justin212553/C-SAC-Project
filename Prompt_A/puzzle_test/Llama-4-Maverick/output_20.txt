To solve this Mate in 2 problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **2R5/1KP1R3/1PnP1Q1P/Pn1q2P1/p4P2/8/1pp2ppp/1k1r4 b - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position**: The FEN indicates it's Black's turn. We need to assess the current position, focusing on the pieces' activity and potential threats.

2. **Assessing the Board**:
   - Material is not the primary concern; finding a checkmate in 2 moves is.
   - The Black king is on b1, and it's relatively exposed but somewhat supported by other pieces.
   - White has a significant presence on the board with active pieces, including a Queen on c6, which is already putting pressure on the Black position.

3. **Identifying Potential Checkmates**:
   - To achieve checkmate in 2 moves, we need to consider the current position and potential moves that could lead to it.
   - The White Queen is already on c6, close to the Black king, and is a potential piece to deliver checkmate or support another piece to do so.

4. **Analyzing Black's Possible Moves**:
   - Since it's Black's turn, we need to consider their possible moves and how White can respond to each to achieve checkmate.
   - Black's king is on b1, so any move that doesn't put the king in a more precarious position or doesn't help White achieve checkmate is worth examining.

5. **Key Observations**:
   - The Black king is somewhat boxed in by White's pieces and its own.
   - White has a strong presence with the Queen and Rooks that could potentially be used to deliver checkmate.

6. **Checking for Forced Moves**:
   - We need to identify a Black move that, when responded to correctly by White, leads to checkmate.
   - The move **1...Nb3** is a potential candidate because it puts the Knight in a position where it can potentially be used to block a check or be part of a combination. However, we need to verify if it leads to a checkmate.
   - Another potential move is **1...Qd4**, but we need to check if White can respond in a way that checkmates Black.

7. **Finding the Checkmate**:
   - Let's consider **1...Nb3** (or other potential Black moves) and see if White can checkmate in the next move.
   - Upon closer inspection, **1...Qe6+** (if possible) or other Queen moves could be critical. However, we need to verify the legality and outcome of such moves.
   - The actual move **1...Qxc6** is a significant candidate because it opens up the possibility for White to respond with a checkmate.

8. **Verifying the Solution**:
   - If Black plays **1...Qxc6+**, White can respond with **2.Kxc6**, but this doesn't immediately appear to checkmate. However, **2.bxc6#** is not possible due to the presence of other pieces and the king's position.
   - Upon closer inspection, after **1...Qxc6+**, **2.Kxc6#** is indeed a checkmate because the White King captures the Queen and simultaneously puts the Black King in checkmate due to the discovered check from the Rook on e7.

Let's directly analyze and provide the PGN:

The best move for Black is **1...Qxc6+**, and White responds with **2.Kxc6#**.

1... Qxc6+
