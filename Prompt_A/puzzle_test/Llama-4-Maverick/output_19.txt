To solve this checkmate in 2, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position**: The FEN indicates it's White's turn, and we need to find a checkmate in 2 moves. The position is quite complex, with many pieces on the board for both sides.

2. **Assessing the Board**:
   - White: King on b1, Queen on d4, Knight on c3 and b4, Rook on d8, Pawns on c2, b7, c7, f3, g3, h3 (though some of these might be typos in the FEN, it's what we have to work with).
   - Black: King on c2, Queen on f3, Rook on d2 and c1, Pawns on a4, b3, f5, g4, h3.

3. **Correcting FEN Understanding**: Let's decode the FEN correctly:
   - **1K1R4**: White King on b1, Rook on d8.
   - **1PP2PPP**: White Pawns on b7, c7, f3, g3, h3 (seems incorrect due to the position of other pieces, likely meant to represent Pawns on b2, f2, g2, h2 or similar).
   - **8**: Empty row.
   - **P4p2**: White Pawn on a5, Black Pawns on e5, f5.
   - **pN1Q2p1**: Black Pawn on a4, White Knight on b4, White Queen on d4, Black Pawn on g4.
   - **1pNp1q1p**: White Pawn on c3 (or Black on c4, but given as White), Black Pawn on b3, White Knight on d3, Black Queen on f3, Black Pawn on h3.
   - **1kp1r3**: Black King on c2, White Pawn or piece on b2 (but likely a Black Pawn is on b3), Black Rook on d2.
   - **2r5**: Black Rook on c1.

4. **Analyzing the Position**: The actual position seems to be: White King on b1, Queen on d4, Knights on b4 and d3, Rook on d8, Pawns on b2 (or c2), c7, b7. Black King on c2, Queen on f3, Rooks on c1 and d2, Pawns on a4, b3, e5, f5, g4, h3.

5. **Finding the Checkmate**:
   - The White Queen is somewhat centralized on d4 but is under attack. The Knights are well-placed, potentially supporting a checkmate or defending against Black's pieces.
   - The Black King is on c2, somewhat exposed but with pieces around it. The checkmate will likely involve coordinating White's pieces to attack the King directly.

6. **Checking Potential Moves**:
   - The White Queen can move to various squares but is somewhat restricted due to the need to checkmate in 2 and the presence of Black's pieces.
   - The Knights are potential candidates for delivering checkmate or supporting a checkmate.

7. **Potential Checkmate**:
   - One potential checkmate involves **Qc3#**, but it's not immediately available in one move due to the Black Rook on c1.
   - Another potential involves using the Knight to support the Queen or directly checkmate.

8. **Solution**:
   - Upon closer inspection, a potential checkmate sequence could involve moving the White Queen to a square that puts it in a position to checkmate the next move or directly checkmates.
   - **1. Qc3+ Kb1 2. Na3#** is a potential sequence if the position allowed for it, but let's directly analyze feasible moves.

Let's directly analyze the given position:
The White Queen on d4 is a key piece. One potential move is **1. Qd1+ Kxd1 2. Nc3#**.

Let's verify:
1. **1. Qd1+**: This move puts the Black King in check. The Black King can capture the Queen: **1... Kxd1**.
2. **2. Nc3#**: This is checkmate as the Knight on c3 (d3 in the initial incorrect interpretation) puts the King in check with no legal moves to escape the check.

Thus, the sequence is: **1. Qd1+ Kxd1 2. Nc3#**.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qd1+ Kxd1 2. Nc3#
