To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand.

The FEN notation **6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1** gives us the current state of the board. Let's break it down:
- The board is set up with Black's king on g8, and White's king on b4, among other pieces.
- The "w" indicates it's White's turn to move.
- The task is to find a checkmate in 1 move.

Let's analyze the position:
1. **Current Position**: White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5. Black has a king on g8 and pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
2. **White's Goal**: Checkmate Black in 1 move.
3. **Available Pieces**: White can move their king or rook.

First, let's consider the White rook on e5. It has the potential to move along the e-file or along the 5th rank. The Black king is on g8, so we need to see if we can checkmate it with the available White pieces.

The Black king is somewhat safe on g8, but we need to check if there's a way to put it in checkmate. The White rook can potentially check the Black king if it moves to e8. Let's analyze this move:
- **Re8#**: If White plays Re8+, it would put the Black king in check. The Black king cannot capture the rook because it's too far away. The king can try to move to f8 or h8, but if there's no other Black piece intervening (and there aren't any), this would be checkmate if the king can't escape the check.

Let's verify:
- The White rook is on e5, and moving it to e8 would put it in a position to potentially checkmate the Black king on g8.
- The move Re8+ is check because it directly attacks the Black king.
- The Black king cannot capture the rook, and there are no other Black pieces that can interpose.

Upon closer inspection, **Re8#** is indeed a checkmate because:
- The Black king cannot move to f8 or h8 without being in check from the White rook, and it's already on g8, which is under attack.
- The White king on b4 is not directly involved in the checkmate but is not in a position to be captured either.

Thus, the checkmate can be achieved by White playing Re8#.
