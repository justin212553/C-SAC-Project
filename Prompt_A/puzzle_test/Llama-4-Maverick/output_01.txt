To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand.

The FEN notation provided is **8/8/8/8/8/6B1/5QN1/5K1k w - - 0 1**. Let's decode this:
- The position is: 8th row is empty, 7th row is empty, ..., down to the 1st row where white's pieces are placed.
- Specifically, the pieces on the board from the 8th to the 1st row are: Empty rows until we get to the 3rd row where a white Bishop is on g3, the 2nd row has a white Queen on f2 and a white Knight on g2, and the 1st row has a white King on f1 and a black King on h1.
- It's white's turn (w).
- There's no castling possible, no en passant, and it's the first move (0 1).

The task is to find a checkmate in 1 move.

Let's analyze:
1. **White's Pieces**: King on f1, Queen on f2, Knight on g2, Bishop on g3.
2. **Black's Pieces**: King on h1.

First, we need to check if the black King is in check and if we can deliver checkmate.

The black King on h1 is not in check. We need to check all possible moves by white that could result in checkmate.

1. **Checking the Queen (f2)**: The Queen can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check if any of these moves result in checkmate. The Queen can move to h4, g1, or other squares along the f-file or on the second rank, but we need a move that puts the black King in checkmate.
   
2. **Checking the Knight (g2)**: The Knight can potentially checkmate if it moves to a square that puts the King in check with no escape. A potential move is to f4 or h4, but these don't directly checkmate because the King isn't on those squares. However, a Knight move to f4 or h4 isn't checkmate anyway since the King can escape or capture. Let's directly examine plausible checkmates.

3. **Checking the Bishop (g3)**: The Bishop can potentially influence the h2 square if it moves, but directly it doesn't checkmate.

Let's directly analyze plausible checkmates:
- The Queen on f2 can potentially checkmate if she moves to f1 (but that's not checkmate as the King can move to g1 or h2), or more interestingly, if there's a way to use the Queen to directly checkmate or support a checkmate.
- A checkmate could be achieved if the white Queen were on h4, but that's not directly possible in one move from f2 without putting the Queen en prise or not resulting in checkmate.

Upon closer inspection:
- **Qf2-h4#** is not possible directly as it would be a good checkmate, but it's not a valid move.
- However, **Qxf1#** or a similar construct isn't valid because the King is on f1, and capturing it would end the game, but it's not a valid checkmate as the objective is to checkmate the black King.

Let's directly check for checkmate patterns:
1. The white Knight on g2 can jump to **f4** or **h4**. **Nh4#** is checkmate because it puts the Knight on h4, checking the King on h1, and there's no escape.

Thus, the solution involves checking if **Nh4#** is a valid move and checkmate.

The white Knight on g2 can move to h4, putting the black King on h1 in checkmate.

The move sequence is as follows:

1. Ng2-h4#

Let's format this according to PGN:

[FINAL PGN]
1. Nh4#
