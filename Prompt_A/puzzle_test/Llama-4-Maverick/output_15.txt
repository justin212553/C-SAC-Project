To solve this checkmate in 2, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand.

The FEN notation **r3r3/p7/1p1n1B2/7R/4k3/PP1p1RP1/7P/3K4 w - - 0 1** gives us the current state of the board. Let's break it down:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The material is not entirely unbalanced, but White has a significant advantage in terms of piece activity and coordination.
- The Black king is on e4, somewhat exposed but with some pieces around it.

First, let's analyze the position:
1. **Material and Piece Placement**: White has a Bishop on f6, a Rook on h5, and another Rook on g3, along with pawns on a2, b2, and h2. The King is on d1. Black has a Knight on d6, Rooks on e8 and a8, pawns on a7, b6, and d3, and the King on e4.

2. **Checking for Checkmate**: To achieve checkmate in 2 moves, we need to look for a sequence where the first move limits Black's responses significantly (ideally to a single or very few moves), and the second move delivers checkmate.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The White Rook on h5 is well-placed to potentially deliver checkmate or support a checkmate.
   - The Black King is on e4, and it's somewhat exposed.
   - The White Bishop on f6 is controlling some key squares around the Black King.
   - The pawn on d3 is a potential weakness for Black as it can be a target, but more importantly, it's not directly relevant to the immediate checkmate.

4. **Analyzing Potential Moves**:
   - The White Rook on g3 can potentially move to g4+, which is a strong candidate because it puts the Black King in check and limits its movement significantly.
   - Other White pieces have limited mobility that can directly lead to checkmate in 2 moves.

5. **Checking the Candidate Move 1.Rg4+**:
   - If 1.Rg4+, the Black King has limited responses. It can go to f5 or d5 (since e5 is not possible due to the Rook on h5 controlling it, and moving to e3 would put it in an illegal position due to being in check from the Rook on g4 and potentially being in the path of the White King or other pieces).
   - On 1...Kf5, White can play 2.Rh5# (or potentially other checkmates, but this is straightforward).
   - On 1...Kd5, White can still play 2.Rh5# or potentially other moves, but Rh5# is checkmate.

Let's directly analyze and verify the move sequence:
1. **1.Rg4+**: This is a check, and it forces the Black King to move.
   - If **1...Kf5**, then **2.Rh5#** is checkmate.
   - If **1...Kd5**, then again, White can play **2.Rh5#** or another checkmate if available.

Let's verify the PGN sequence.
