To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position using the FEN notation: **5k2/5P2/4PK2/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1**.

Breaking down the FEN:
- The position is: White has a King and a Pawn, and Black has a King. The White King is on f6, the White Pawn is on f7, and the Black King is on f8.
- The side to move is White.
- There are no castling rights available for either side.
- There is no en passant square.
- The half-move clock is 0, and the full move number is 1.

The task is to find a checkmate in 1 move.

1. **Assessing the Position**: The White King is on f6, and the Black King is on f8. The White Pawn on f7 is crucial as it is close to promoting. The White King is somewhat restricting the Black King's movement.

2. **Identifying Potential Moves**: 
   - The White King can potentially move to e7, f7 (though f7 is occupied), g7, or other adjacent squares. However, we need to check if any of these moves directly lead to checkmate or set up for checkmate.
   - The White Pawn on f7 is a key piece. It is already putting the Black King in a difficult position by controlling the f8 square and being on the verge of promoting.

3. **Analyzing Checkmate Conditions**: For White to checkmate Black in 1 move, we need to consider the possible moves that would put the Black King in check with no legal moves to escape the check.

4. **Checking Possible Moves**:
   - If White moves their King to g7 or e7, it could potentially be a check or support a promotion/checkmate. Let's examine these:
     - Kg7#: If White plays Kg7, it directly puts the Black King in checkmate because the King is moving to a square the Black King cannot escape from due to the support from the Pawn on f7.
     - Ke7#: Similarly, moving the King to e7 would also be checkmate for the same reason; the Black King cannot move to a safe square.

5. **Choosing the Correct Move**: 
   - Between Kg7# and Ke7#, both are potential checkmates. The FEN indicates White to move, and both moves are valid checkmates.

6. **PGN Notation**: 
   - The PGN for Kg7# would be "1. Kg7#".
   - The PGN for Ke7# would be "1. Ke7#".

Both moves are valid, but we need to output one. Let's go with the first logical checkmate move that comes to mind which is **1. Kg7#** or **1. Ke7#**. Both are acceptable, but the format requires a single output.
