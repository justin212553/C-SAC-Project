To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is defined by the FEN: **5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1**. This means it's White's turn, and we need to find a checkmate in 1 move.

Let's decode the FEN:
- **5rkr**: Black's back rank has a Rook on the f-file, a King on the g-file, and a Rook on the h-file.
- **5ppp**: Black's second rank (from their perspective) has pawns on the f, g, and h files.
- **8/8/8/8**: Empty ranks in between.
- **4N1R1**: White has a Knight on the e4 square and a Rook on the g4 square.
- **8**: An empty rank.
- **6K1**: White's King is on the g2 square, and there's a empty square on f2 (implying the f-file is clear up to the second rank).

Given this setup, let's analyze the position:
1. White's King is on g2, which is relatively safe for the moment.
2. White has a Knight on e4 and a Rook on g4. The Rook on g4 is particularly well-placed to potentially attack Black's King on g8, given the right circumstances.
3. Black's King is on g8, somewhat exposed but currently defended by the Rook on f8 and the pawns in front.

To checkmate in 1, we need to look for a move that puts Black's King in an inescapable check. The most likely candidate involves the White Rook on g4, as it's already on the same rank as Black's King.

Let's examine potential checks and see if any of them are checkmates:
- The White Rook on g4 can potentially move to g7 or g8 to put Black's King in check. Moving to g7 would be **Rg7+**, but Black could potentially respond with ...Kg8 or other moves, though this needs checking.
- **Rg7+** is a check, but let's directly examine if there's a more direct checkmate.

Checking **Rg8+**: If White plays **Rxg8#** (Rook on g4 captures g8), it's checkmate because the Black King can't escape the check due to being on the last rank and having no legal moves to get out of check.

Let's directly verify if **Rxg8#** is valid:
1. White's Rook is on g4.
2. It can capture the Black Rook on g8.
3. This capture puts the Black King in checkmate because it's on the same rank and file as the White Rook, with no intervening pieces or legal moves to escape the check.

Thus, the move **Rxg8#** is a valid checkmate. Let's format it according to PGN.
