To solve this Mate in 2 problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position:**
   - The FEN indicates it's Black's turn to move.
   - The position of the pieces is as follows: White has a King on g8, a Bishop on e8, a Rook on h7, a Rook on a6, and a Rook on h1. Black has a King on c3, a Queen on d3, a Rook on f6, and a Bishop on d4.

2. **Analyzing the Position:**
   - The Black King is somewhat exposed on c3 but is somewhat supported by the Bishop on d4 and the Queen on d3.
   - The White King is relatively safe on g8, supported by the Bishop on e8 and the Rooks on a6, h7, and h1.
   - The task is to find a Mate in 2, meaning we need to checkmate the White King in two moves.

3. **Identifying Potential Checks and Threats:**
   - The White King is on g8, so potential checks involve moving a piece to f7, g7, or h8. However, we need to consider the pieces available to Black and their potential moves.
   - The Black Queen on d3 is a powerful piece that can potentially move to threaten the White King, but it's currently somewhat restricted.
   - The Black Rook on f6 can potentially move to f7 or f8 to check the White King if other pieces cooperate.

4. **Exploring Possible First Moves:**
   - To checkmate in 2, the first move must be such that it forces a response from White that can be followed by a checkmate.
   - One potential check is **1... Rf8+**, but we need to verify if it leads to a checkmate in the next move.

5. **Analyzing the Move 1... Rf8+:**
   - If Black plays **1... Rf8+**, White is forced to respond. The King can move to e7 or f7. 
   - **2. Ke7** can be met with **2... Qd7#** if the Queen can reach d7, which is possible as the Queen is already on d3 and can move to d7.
   - **2. Kxf8** is not possible because the White King cannot capture the Rook on f8 due to it being a check from f8.

6. **Checking the Feasibility:**
   - Let's verify if **1... Rf8+** is a valid move and if White's responses can be checkmated on the next move.
   - **1... Rf8+ 2. Ke7 Qd7#** seems plausible because after **1... Rf8+**, White's King moves to e7, and then **2... Qd7#** checkmates it.

7. **PGN Generation:**
   - The move sequence is: **1... Rf8+ 2. Ke7 Qd7#**.

Let's directly output the solution as per the instructions.
