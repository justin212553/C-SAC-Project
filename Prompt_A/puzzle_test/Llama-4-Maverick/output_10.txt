To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position and the task. The FEN notation provided is **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1**. This breaks down into the following position:
- The board has Black's king on e3, Black's pawn on f2, and White's king on f1.
- It's Black's turn to move.

First, let's decode the FEN:
- **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2** represents the piece positions on the board. The numbers represent empty squares, and the letters represent pieces (k for king, p for pawn).
- **b** indicates it's Black's turn.
- **-** indicates there are no en passant captures possible.
- **-** followed by **0 1** gives the number of moves since the last pawn move and the full move count, respectively.

The task is to find a checkmate for Black in 1 move.

Let's analyze:
1. **Black's King Position**: The Black king is on e3.
2. **White's King Position**: The White king is on f1.
3. **Black's Pawn on f2**: This pawn is crucial as it is close to promoting.

To checkmate White, Black needs to put White's king in a position where it is in check with no legal moves to remove the king from capture (checkmate).

The White king is on f1. For Black to checkmate White, considering the pieces on the board, the most likely scenario involves the Black king or the Black pawn.

Let's examine possible moves:
- The Black king (e3) can move to d2, d3, e2, f3, f4, or e4. Moving to e2 would put the White king in check, but we need to verify if it's checkmate.
- The Black pawn (f2) can potentially promote or move to f1.

If Black's king moves to **e2**, it puts White's king in check. White's king can then try to move to g2 or e1 (since f2 is occupied by a Black pawn and e2 is where the Black king is moving to). However, we need to check if this results in checkmate.

Let's analyze **1...Ke2**:
- White's king can move to g2 or e1. If it moves to g2, it's not checkmate because the king is safe there. If it moves to e1, it's also not checkmate because the king is safe.

However, promoting the pawn to a queen by **1...f1=Q** would be checkmate because White's king is on f1, and adding a Black queen on f1 would directly attack the king with no escape.

Let's verify if **1...f1=Q** is indeed checkmate:
- White's king is on f1.
- **1...f1=Q** promotes the pawn to a queen, directly attacking the White king.
- The White king cannot escape the check by moving to any adjacent square (e1, e2, f2, g1, g2) because they are either occupied or would still be in check.

Thus, **1...f1=Q#** is checkmate.

[FINAL PGN]
1... f1=Q#
