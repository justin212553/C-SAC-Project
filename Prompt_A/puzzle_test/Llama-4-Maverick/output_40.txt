To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is defined by the FEN: **r3k2r/pQ3pp1/2p3q1/3n4/1n1P2bp/4P3/1P1NNPPP/R1B1KB1R b - - 0 1**. We need to find a forced checkmate in 4 moves (Mate in 4).

First, let's decode the FEN to understand the position:
- **r3k2r**: Black's rook, empty, empty, king, empty, empty, rook. This indicates that Black's king is in the middle, and both rooks are on the back rank, suggesting that Black has not castled or has lost the right to castle kingside or queenside.
- **pQ3pp1**: Black's pawn, White's queen, empty, empty, pawn, pawn, empty. The White queen is on b7, which is an aggressive position.
- **2p3q1**: Two empty, pawn, empty, empty, Black's queen, empty. Black's queen is on g6.
- **3n4**: Three empty, Black's knight. The knight is on d5.
- **1n1P2bp**: Empty, Black's knight, White's pawn on d4, empty, empty, Black's bishop, pawn. The White pawn on d4 is a potential weakness or strength depending on how it's used.
- **4P3**: Four empty, White's pawn. The pawn is on e3.
- **1P1NNPPP**: Empty, White's pawn on b2, empty, White's knights on d2 and e2, White's pawns on f2, g2, h2. White has a relatively normal pawn structure and two knights developed.
- **R1B1KB1R**: White's rook, empty, White's bishop, empty, White's king, White's bishop, empty, White's rook. White's king is on f1, indicating that White has likely lost the right to castle or has chosen not to castle.

Given that it's Black's turn and we are looking for a Mate in 4, we need to consider the most forcing moves and the potential responses by White.

1. **Assessing the Position**: The Black king is somewhat exposed in the center. Black has a significant material presence with two knights, a queen, and a bishop developed. White's king is also somewhat exposed on f1, but White has a strong queen on b7.

2. **Identifying Candidate Moves**: 
   - The Black queen on g6 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move to other squares to attack or support other pieces.
   - The knights on b4 and d5 are well-placed to potentially attack White's position or support other pieces.
   - The bishop on g4 can potentially be a strong piece or a weakness depending on how the position unfolds.

3. **Analyzing Potential Moves**:
   - **1... Qxg2+**: This move is very tempting as it checks the White king and potentially opens up further attacking possibilities. 
   - If White responds with **2. Ke1** (or **2. Kxg2**), Black can continue with a strong follow-up.

Let's analyze the move sequence:
1... Qxg2+ 
2. Ke1 (Forced to get out of check)
2... Nd3+ 
3. Kd1 (Again, forced to get out of check)
3... Qf1+ 
4. Nxf1 Nf2# 

Let's verify if this sequence is correct and leads to a Mate in 4.

1. **1... Qxg2+**: Checking the White king.
2. **2. Ke1 Nd3+**: Forcing the White king to move again.
3. **3. Kd1 Qf1+**: Continuing the check, forcing White's response.
4. **4. Nxf1 Nf2#**: Checkmating White.

Let's format this into PGN:

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qxg2+ 2. Ke1 Nd3+ 3. Kd1 Qf1+ 4. Nxf1 Nf2#
