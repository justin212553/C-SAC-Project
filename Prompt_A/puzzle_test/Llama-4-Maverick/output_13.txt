To solve this checkmate in 2, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **8/p1K5/k1P5/8/1p6/3P1P2/5R2/4R3 w - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position:**
   - The FEN indicates it's White's turn, and we are looking for a checkmate in 2 moves.
   - The material is not significantly imbalanced, but the positioning is crucial.
   - White has a King on c7, pawns on c6 and d3 and f3, and rooks on f2 and e1. Black has a King on a6, pawns on a7 and b4.

2. **Analyzing the Position:**
   - The White King is somewhat exposed but is somewhat supported by the pawn on c6. 
   - The Black King is relatively safe on a6, given the current position, but is restricted in movement due to the c6 pawn.
   - White's task is to checkmate Black in 2 moves.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The Black King is limited in its movement due to the White pawn on c6. It can potentially move to a5 or b6 if not for the presence of the White pawn controlling b6 and potentially being supported to restrict a5.
   - White's rooks are well-placed on the second and first ranks, potentially ready to swing into action on the kingside or support a checkmate on the queenside.
   - The White pawn on c6 effectively anchors the Black King, limiting its mobility.

4. **Potential Checkmate Patterns:**
   - To checkmate, White needs to consider how to use the available pieces effectively. The rooks can potentially deliver checkmate or support a checkmate.
   - One potential checkmate pattern involves using the rooks to restrict the Black King's movement further and deliver checkmate.

5. **Calculating the Moves:**
   - First, we need to identify a move that puts Black in a position where they cannot avoid checkmate on the next move.
   - The move **1. Rb2** is a candidate because it threatens to potentially restrict Black's movement further or create a threat. However, let's directly analyze the most promising lines.
   - A more direct approach involves checking if there's a straightforward checkmate or a simple sequence that leads to it.

6. **Direct Analysis:**
   - Upon closer inspection, a potential checkmate sequence starts with **1. Rb1**, threatening to potentially check or checkmate. However, let's directly find the correct sequence.
   - The correct sequence involves understanding that **1. Rd1** followed by a potential second move could be effective, but let's directly identify the checkmate.

7. **The Checkmate Sequence:**
   - The White rooks can be used effectively. One possible checkmate involves **1. Rb2 b3** (forced to avoid a worse fate or not having a better move) and then looking for a checkmate.
   - However, the actual checkmate sequence is more straightforward: **1. Rd1 b3 2. Rb2#**.

Let's directly verify and simplify the thought process to the actual checkmate sequence.

The actual checkmate sequence is:
1. Rd1 b3
2. Rb2#

Let's directly output the PGN.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Rd1 b3 2. Rb2#
