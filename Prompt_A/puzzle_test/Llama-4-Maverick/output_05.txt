To solve this Mate in 1 problem, let's first understand the given position and then analyze it step by step.

The given FEN is: **8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1**

Let's decode this FEN:
- The board is represented by rows starting from the 8th rank down to the 1st rank.
- **8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7**: 
  - The 8th rank is empty.
  - On the 7th rank, there's a White Rook on the h-file.
  - On the 6th rank, the Black King is on the a-file.
  - On the 5th rank, there's a White Pawn on the c-file.
  - On the 4th rank, there are White Pawns on b and c files, and a White Bishop on the g-file (since the count starts from the a-file).
  - The 3rd, 2nd, and 1st ranks are empty except for the White King on the a-file on the 1st rank.

So, the position is: The White King is on a1, a White Rook is on h7, a White Bishop is on g4, White Pawns are on b4, c4, and c5, and the Black King is on a6.

The task is to find a checkmate in 1 move.

First, let's assess the Black King's position and possible moves. The Black King is on a6. It can potentially move to a5, a7, or b6, but we need to check if these moves are legal given the current position.

1. **a5**: This move is possible if there's no White piece controlling a5 directly.
2. **a7**: This is a potential move.
3. **b6**: This move is possible but could be restricted by White pieces.

Let's examine White's pieces and their potential to checkmate or restrict the Black King's movement:
- The White Rook on h7 is already putting the Black King in check. However, we need to verify if it's checkmate.
- The White Bishop on g4 is somewhat active but not directly participating in the check or checkmate on the King's current position.
- The White King is on a1, far from directly influencing the checkmate but can potentially move to support or uncover an attack.

Let's analyze potential checkmate patterns:
1. The White Rook on h7 is already checking the Black King. The King can't capture it because it's too far away. Let's see if the King can escape the check:
   - Moving to a5 or b6 would still be under the Rook's influence or other White pieces potentially controlling those squares.
   - Moving to a7 is the only viable escape route.

To checkmate, we need to ensure the White Rook's check is not escapable. The Rook is on h7, checking the King on a6. The King can potentially escape to a7.

However, we can use the fact that the White Rook is already checking to our advantage. Let's directly check for checkmate:
- The White Rook on h7 is checking. If we can ensure the Black King can't escape or capture the Rook, it's potentially checkmate.

Let's directly analyze the checkmate condition:
- The Black King can't capture the Rook.
- It can't move to a5 because c5 is controlled by a White Pawn (though it's on c5, not directly controlling a5, the presence of other White pieces and the Rook's check is crucial).
- It can't move to b6 because of the potential influence of White pieces or being in the Rook's check.
- It can't move to a7 because the Rook can potentially support this by being on the 7th rank.

Upon closer inspection, we see that **Rb7#** is a potential checkmate as it covers the escape squares and directly checks the King.

Let's verify the move:
1. **1.Rb7#**: This move puts the Black King in checkmate. The Rook moves to b7, checking the King and controlling the potential escape squares effectively.

The thought process involves checking the current position, understanding the pieces' influence, and directly identifying the checkmate pattern.

1. Rb7#
