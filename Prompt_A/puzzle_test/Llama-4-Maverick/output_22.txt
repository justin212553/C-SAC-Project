To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is given in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) as **1k6/1p6/5r2/3q2p1/Qp1P4/4PrPp/2R4P/R5K1 b - - 0 1**. We need to find a forced checkmate in 3 moves.

First, let's decode the FEN notation:
- **1k6**: The black king is on b8.
- **1p6**: There's a black pawn on b7.
- **5r2**: A black rook is on f6.
- **3q2p1**: The black queen is on d5, and there's a black pawn on g5.
- **Qp1P4**: The white queen is on a4, and there's a white pawn on d4, and a black pawn on b4.
- **4PrPp**: A white pawn on g3, a black pawn on f3, and a white rook or other piece on e3 is not possible due to the presence of other pieces; hence, it's likely indicating a white pawn or piece on e3, but given the context, it's a white pawn or the presence of a piece that isn't directly visible. However, the 'P' indicates a white pawn on e3. There's also a black pawn on h3.
- **2R4P**: A white rook on c2 and a white pawn on h2.
- **R5K1**: A white rook on a1 and the white king on g1.

Given it's black's turn and we're looking for a Mate in 3, we need to analyze the position:

1. The black king is somewhat safe on b8, but it can be potentially exposed.
2. The white king is on g1, somewhat safe but needs to be checked for potential vulnerabilities.
3. Black has a significant material advantage and active pieces.

Let's analyze potential moves:
- The black queen on d5 is well-placed, exerting influence on the center and potentially towards the white king.
- The black rooks are also active, with one on f6 and potentially the other could be developed or used effectively.
- The presence of pawns on f3 and h3 suggests a potential weakness around the white king if it were to be exposed.

To achieve checkmate in 3 moves, we need to look for a sequence that:
1. Puts the white king in a vulnerable position.
2. Ensures that the white king cannot escape the checkmate.

Let's directly analyze potential checkmate sequences:
1. **1... Qd1+** (Putting the white king in check, forcing it to move or block with a piece)
   - If **2. Kg2**, then Black can play **Qe2+**.
     - If **3. Kg1**, then **Rf1#**.

Let's verify the move sequence and ensure it's legal and leads to checkmate.

1. The initial position is given, and it's black's turn.
2. **1... Qd1+** is a check. The white king must respond.
3. The most likely response to **1... Qd1+** is **2. Kg2** because it gets the king out of the check and into a relatively safer position, though still potentially vulnerable.
4. Then, **2... Qe2+** puts the king in check again.
5. The king can move back to **g1**, and then **3... Rf1#** is checkmate.

So, the sequence is:
1... Qd1+
2. Kg2 Qe2+
3. Kg1 Rf1#

Let's format this according to the PGN notation.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qd1+ 2. Kg2 Qe2+ 3. Kg1 Rf1#
