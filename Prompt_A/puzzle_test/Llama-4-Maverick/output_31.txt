To solve this checkmate in 4, let's first analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **6kn/5p1p/6p1/2B1P3/1P2P3/5P2/2r3PP/R5K1 w - - 0 1**.

1. **Understanding the Position**: 
   - White is to move.
   - The Black king is somewhat exposed on 'h8' with a Knight on 'g8'.
   - White has a Bishop on 'c5', potentially exerting influence on the Black position, and other pieces that could potentially be developed or used to attack.

2. **Assessing the Material and Position**:
   - Material is not the primary concern; finding a checkmate sequence is.
   - White has a significant advantage in terms of piece development and coordination.

3. **Identifying Potential Checkmate Patterns**:
   - The Black king is on 'h8', so a checkmate likely involves the White pieces coordinating to attack 'h8' or 'g7' and 'f7' to force a checkmate.
   - The White Bishop on 'c5' is somewhat active, but its influence is somewhat limited. Other White pieces need to be developed or used effectively.

4. **Analyzing Candidate Moves**:
   - The first move should aim at either directly checking the king or setting up for a checkmate.
   - **1.Ra8** seems like a potential starting move as it puts the Rook on the same rank as the Black king and potentially clears the way for other pieces to participate in the attack.

5. **Calculating the Sequence**:
   - **1.Ra8** could be met with **1...Rxa8** (forced to deal with the Rook on the 8th rank).
   - Then, we need to look for a checkmate pattern. 
   - After **1.Ra8 Rxa8**, we have the position where White needs to continue the attack.
   - **2.Bf8** could be a move that sets up for checkmate, as it puts the Bishop on a more active square and potentially prepares to deliver checkmate with other pieces.
   - Continuing this line, after **2...g5** (trying to prevent further White piece advancement or checking), White needs to find a checkmate.
   - **3.g4** doesn't directly check but prepares to potentially check or support a checkmate. However, a more direct approach is needed.
   - Upon closer inspection, a more forcing sequence is required.

Let's directly analyze the moves:
1. The White Rook can move to 'a8', checking is not immediate but it is a starting point.
2. After **1.Ra8 Rxa8**, White can play **2.Bf8**, threatening to checkmate or forcing Black into a difficult position.

Let's directly find the checkmate:
1. **1.Ra8 Rxa8**
2. **2.Bf8 Nxf8** (or other moves, but this is a natural response)
3. **3.exf8=Q+** (promoting and checking)
4. **4.Qg7#**

Let's verify the sequence and provide the PGN.
