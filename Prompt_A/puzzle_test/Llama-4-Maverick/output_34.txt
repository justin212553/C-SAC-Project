To solve this chess puzzle, let's first understand the given position and the task at hand. The position is defined by the FEN: **r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1**. We need to find a forced checkmate in 4 moves (Mate in 4).

First, let's decode the FEN to understand the position:
- **r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3**: This indicates the piece placement on the board.
  - Black's king is on h8, and it's Black's turn.
  - White has a Knight on e8, which is somewhat awkwardly placed but controls several squares.
  - There are several pieces on the board, with both sides having material, but White has a significant presence on the board with two Rooks potentially active.

Let's analyze the position:
1. **Black's King Safety**: The Black king is on h8 and is somewhat exposed but currently not in check. However, it's crucial to note that the White Rook on f7 is quite active and potentially threatening.

2. **Material and Piece Activity**: Black has a Rook on c2, which is somewhat active, and a Bishop on g4, which is somewhat pinned due to the potential discovery by the White Knight on e8. White has a strong presence with Rooks on f7 and f2, and the Knight on e8 is quite influential.

3. **Checking for Mate in 4**: To achieve checkmate in 4 moves, we need to look for a sequence that forces White to respond in a limited way, ultimately leading to a checkmate.

Let's start by examining potential Black moves that could initiate a checkmate sequence:
- The Black Rook on c2 is somewhat active and could potentially move to c1 to deliver checkmate if the White King were on a different square or if other pieces were rearranged.
- The Black Knight on d4 is a potential candidate for delivering check or participating in a checkmate pattern.

Let's consider the moves:
1... **Bxf2+** is an interesting starting move because it checks the White King and forces a response. If White plays **Kxf2**, then Black can continue with **Nf3+**, checking again and potentially setting up for a stronger attack or forcing White into a difficult position.

Let's analyze the sequence:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Kxf3 (Forced to avoid further checks or material loss) 
3... Rxc1+ 
4. Ke2 (or other moves, but this is relatively better) 
4... Rc2# is not possible because White can interpose or move the King. Let's re-evaluate the moves.

Re-evaluating:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Ke2 (If 3. Kg3, then Rh2 is a strong threat)

Let's directly analyze the correct sequence:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Ke2 Rxc1+ 
or alternative sequences.

Upon detailed analysis, a potential checkmate sequence is:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Ke2 Rxc1+ 
4. (Any move) followed by checkmate.

Let's directly check the most plausible sequence:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Ke2 Rxc1+ 
4. Kxf3 (or other moves) and then checkmate.

The actual sequence to checkmate is:
1... Bxf2+ 
2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 
3. Ke2 Rxc1+ 
4. Kd3 Rc2#

Let's format this into PGN.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Bxf2+ 2. Kxf2 Nf3+ 3. Ke2 Rxc1+ 4. Kd3 Rc2#
