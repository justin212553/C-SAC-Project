This is a mate-in-1 puzzle. The goal is for Black to deliver a checkmate in a single move.

**1. Analyze the White King's Position:**
The White King is on a3. Let's examine its potential escape squares: a2, a4, b2, b3, and b4.

*   **a2:** Controlled by the Black Rook on h2.
*   **a4:** Controlled by the Black pawn on b5.
*   **b2:** Controlled by the Black Rook on h2.
*   **b3:** Controlled by the Black pawn on c4.
*   **b4:** Controlled by the Black pawn on c5 and the Black Bishop on g5.

The White King has no legal moves. It is completely trapped. This means any move by Black that delivers a check will be checkmate, provided the checking piece cannot be captured and the check cannot be blocked.

**2. Identify Candidate Moves for Black:**
We need to find a move that puts the White King on a3 in check.

*   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on b5 can move to b4, attacking the King on a3. The move is `...b4+`.
*   **Rook moves:** The Rook on h2 can check the King along the 2nd rank (`...Ra2+`, `...Rb2+`, etc.) or along the h-file if it moves to h3 (`...Rh3+`).
*   **Bishop moves:** The Bishop on g5 can check the King along the a1-h8 diagonal (`...Bf4+`, `...Be3+`, etc.).

**3. Evaluate the Candidates:**
Let's take the simplest candidate, `...b4`.

*   **Is it a check?** Yes, the pawn on b4 attacks the King on a3.
*   **Can the King escape?** No, as established, all escape squares are covered.
*   **Can the checking piece be captured?** No White piece can capture the pawn on b4.
*   **Can the check be blocked?** A pawn check cannot be blocked.

Since the move `...b4` is a check and there is no legal way for White to get out of it, it is checkmate. Other moves like `...Ra2#` or `...Bf4#` would also be checkmate for the same reasons.

**Conclusion:**
The move `...b4` delivers a decisive checkmate.
