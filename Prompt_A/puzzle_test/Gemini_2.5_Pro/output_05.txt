This is a mate-in-1 puzzle.

1.  **Analyze the Black King's position:** The Black King is on a6. I need to check all its potential escape squares.
    *   a5 is controlled by the White pawn on b4.
    *   b5 is controlled by the White pawn on c4.
    *   b6 is controlled by the White pawn on c5.
    *   a7 and b7 are controlled by the White Rook on h7.
    *   The Black King has no legal moves. This means any move by White that delivers a check will be checkmate, as long as the checking move doesn't illegally open up an escape square.

2.  **Find checking moves for White:** I will look for all possible checks.
    *   **Pawn moves:** The pawn on b4 can move to b5, delivering a check to the King on a6. `b5+`.
    *   **Bishop moves:** The Bishop on g4 can move to f5, delivering a check. `Bf5+`.
    *   **Rook moves:** The Rook on h7 can move to a7, delivering a check. `Ra7+`.

3.  **Verify the checkmates:** Since the Black King has no escape squares to begin with, and none of the checking moves open any new squares, all three candidate moves are checkmate.
    *   `b5#`: The pawn on b5 attacks the King. The King cannot move to a5 (attacked by the b5 pawn), b5 (attacked by the c4 pawn), b6 (attacked by the c5 pawn), a7 or b7 (attacked by the h7 Rook). This is a valid checkmate.
    *   `Bf5#`: The Bishop on f5 attacks the King. The King cannot move to a5 (b4 pawn), b5 (c4 pawn), b6 (c5 pawn), a7 or b7 (h7 Rook). This is a valid checkmate.
    *   `Ra7#`: The Rook on a7 attacks the King. The King cannot move to a5 (b4 pawn), b5 (c4 pawn), b6 (c5 pawn), or b7 (a7 Rook). This is a valid checkmate.

Any of these moves solves the puzzle. I will provide `b5#` as the solution.

[FINAL PGN]
