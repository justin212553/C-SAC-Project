The user wants me to solve a Mate in 1 puzzle.

**1. Analyze the position:**
*   White's pieces: King on b4, Rook on e5.
*   Black's pieces: King on g8, Pawns on f7, g7, h7.
*   It is White's turn to move.
*   The goal is to find a checkmate in one move.

**2. Identify candidate moves:**
I need to find a move that puts the Black King in check and from which the King cannot escape. The only piece White can move to deliver a check is the Rook on e5.

Let's list all possible checks:
*   `Re8+`
*   `Rg5+`

**3. Evaluate the candidate moves:**

*   **`Rg5+`**: The Rook on g5 checks the King on g8. However, the King can escape to h8. So, this is not checkmate.

*   **`Re8+`**: The Rook on e8 checks the King on g8. Let's analyze the Black King's options:
    *   **Can the King move?**
        *   The squares f8 and h8 are controlled by the Rook on e8.
        *   The squares f7, g7, and h7 are either controlled by the Rook (f7) or blocked by Black's own pawns (g7, h7).
        *   Therefore, the King has no legal moves.
    *   **Can the check be blocked?** No black piece can move between the Rook on e8 and the King on g8.
    *   **Can the checking piece be captured?** No black piece can capture the Rook on e8.

Since the King is in check and has no legal way to get out of check, `Re8#` is checkmate. This is a classic back-rank mate pattern.

**4. Final conclusion:**
The correct move is `Re8#`.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Re8#
