An analysis of the position is required to find the forced mate in 3 for Black.

**Position Analysis:**
The White king is on g1, with a bishop on f1. The Black rook on e1 creates a powerful pin on the f1-bishop. The White king's pawn cover (f2, g3, h2) is a potential target for the Black queen on h3. The Black knight on d5 is well-placed to join the attack. White's knights on d6 and e5 are strong pieces, but they are not positioned to defend the king effectively against a direct assault.

**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**

1.  **...Nf4+**: This is the most forcing move. It's a check, which severely limits White's responses.
    *   White's king cannot move to h1 because the square is controlled by the Black queen on h3.
    *   Therefore, White is forced to capture the knight: `2. gxf4`.
    *   This capture opens the g-file, which is a fatal concession. Black continues the attack with `2... Qg4+`.
    *   This check forces the White king to the only available square: `3. Kh1`.
    *   Now, Black delivers the final blow with `3... Rxe1#`. The rook on e1 checkmates the king on h1. The king cannot escape to g1 (controlled by the rook) or g2/h2 (controlled by the queen). The bishop on f1 is pinned by the queen on g4 and cannot intervene. This is a clear mate in 3.

2.  **...fxe5**: This move captures a key defender but is not as forcing. White can respond with `2. Nf7+`, checking the Black king and disrupting Black's mating plan. After `2... Rxf7`, White can play `3. Qxh3`, and the immediate threat is gone.

3.  **...Qg4**: This move threatens mate on g2, but it's too slow. White can defend with `2. Nf7+` or even `2. Qe4`, and the forced mate is no longer possible.

**Conclusion:**
The move `1... Nf4+` initiates a forcing sequence that White cannot escape. Each of White's responses is forced, leading directly to checkmate on the third move.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Nf4+
2. gxf4 Qg4+
3. Kh1 Rxe1#
