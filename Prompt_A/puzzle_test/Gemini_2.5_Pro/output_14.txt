An analysis of the position reveals the following:

*   **White's King:** The white king is on a3, severely restricted. The squares b2 and b3 are key. The b2 square is controlled by both the black king on c2 and the black pawn on c3. The b3 square is controlled by the black king on c2.
*   **White's Escape Squares:** The only potential escape squares for the white king are a4 and b4.
*   **Black's Goal:** Black must find a move that forces checkmate on the subsequent turn, regardless of White's reply.

**Thought Process:**

1.  First, I considered immediate checks. The most obvious check is `1... Ra7+`.
    *   If `1... Ra7+`, White has two legal responses: `2. Ka4` and `2. Kb4`.
    *   If White plays `2. Ka4`, Black can respond with `2... Ra4#`, which is checkmate.
    *   However, if White plays `2. Kb4`, Black has no immediate mate. The white king gains new escape squares like a5 and c5. Since a mate in 2 must work against all of White's legal replies, `1... Ra7+` is not the solution.

2.  Since a direct check doesn't work, the solution is likely a quiet move that restricts the white king further. The key is to take away the `b4` escape square.

3.  I considered the move `1... Rb7`.
    *   This move is not a check, but it cleverly controls the b-file and, crucially, the `b4` square.
    *   Now, let's look at White's legal moves. The king on a3 cannot move to `b4` (controlled by the rook on b7) and cannot move to `b2` (controlled by the king on c2 and pawn on c3).
    *   This leaves White with only one legal move: `2. Ka4`. The move is forced.

4.  After White's forced move `2. Ka4`, the position is set for Black's final blow.
    *   Black can now play `2... Rb4#`.
    *   This is checkmate because:
        *   The king on a4 is in check from the rook on b4.
        *   The escape square `b3` is covered by the black king on c2.
        *   The escape squares `a5`, `b5`, and `b4` are all covered by the attacking rook on b4.

This sequence is a forced mate in two moves.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rb7 2. Ka4 Rb4#
