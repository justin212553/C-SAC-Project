1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - Black to move.
   - The black king is on a8, and the white king is on a3.
   - Black has a bishop on g5, a pawn on c5, a pawn on c4, and a rook on h2.
   - White has no immediate threats, and Black has a clear opportunity to deliver checkmate.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The black rook on h2 can move to h3, delivering checkmate. This is because:
     - The white king on a3 has no escape squares due to the black pawns on c5 and c4, and the black bishop on g5 controlling the a3-f6 diagonal.
     - The rook on h3 directly attacks the white king, and no white piece can block or capture the rook.

3. **Verification**:
   - After 1... Rh3#, the white king is in check and has no legal moves.
   - This is a forced mate in 1.
