1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - Black to move.
   - The black king is on f8, and the white king is on h7.
   - Black has a queen on g7 and a bishop on g6.
   - White has no other pieces except the king.

2. **Objective**: Deliver checkmate in one move.

3. **Candidate Moves**:
   - The black queen on g7 can deliver a checkmate by moving to h7. This move puts the white king in check, and there are no legal moves for White to escape the checkmate:
     - The white king on h7 is attacked directly by the black queen on h7.
     - The white king cannot move to g8 or g6 because both squares are controlled by the black bishop on g6.
     - The white king cannot capture the black queen on h7 because it is protected by the black king on f8.

4. **Verification**:
   - No other black moves deliver checkmate in one move.
   - The move Qh7# is legal and forces checkmate.
