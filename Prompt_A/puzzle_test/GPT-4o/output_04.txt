1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - Black to move.
   - The black king is on b5, and the white king is on g1. Black has a rook on e4, while White has pawns on f2, g2, and h2.
   - The goal is to deliver a forced checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The black rook on e4 has the potential to deliver a checkmate by moving to a square where the white king cannot escape.
   - The white king on g1 is restricted in movement due to its position and the pawns blocking its escape routes.

3. **Evaluation of Moves**:
   - **Re1+**: This move puts the white king in check, but it is not a checkmate because the white king can escape to h2.
   - **Re2+**: This move puts the white king in check, but it is not a checkmate because the white king can escape to h2.
   - **Re5**: This move does not deliver a check or checkmate.
   - **Re3+**: This move puts the white king in check, but it is not a checkmate because the white king can escape to h2.
   - **Re1#**: This move delivers checkmate because the white king on g1 has no legal moves. The pawns on f2, g2, and h2 block its escape, and the rook on e1 controls the entire e-file.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The move **Re1#** is the only move that delivers a forced checkmate in one move.
