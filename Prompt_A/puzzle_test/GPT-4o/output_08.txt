1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - Black to move.
   - The white king is on g1, and the black rook is on g5, which can deliver a check along the g-file.
   - The black knight on e5 is well-placed to control escape squares for the white king.
   - White pawns and rook are not in a position to block or capture the attacking pieces.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The black rook on g5 can move to g1, delivering a check.
   - The white king on g1 has no escape squares because:
     - The knight on e5 controls f3 and g4.
     - The rook on g1 would control the entire g-file.
     - The white pawns block the king's movement to f2 and h2.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1...Rg1#, the white king is in check and has no legal moves. This is a forced checkmate.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The move 1...Rg1# is a forced mate in 1.
