1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - Black to move.
   - Black's king is on g8, and it is relatively exposed.
   - White's rook on c7 is very active and can deliver checks.
   - Black's pawns are mostly immobile, and White's king is far from the action.
   - The key to solving this puzzle is to force the Black king into a position where it cannot escape checks, leading to a forced mate.

2. **Candidate Moves for Black**:
   - Black has limited options. The only piece that can move is the bishop on c4, which can either stay on the diagonal or move to a square like d3 or e2. However, these moves do not prevent White's attack.
   - Black's pawns are blocked or irrelevant to the defense.

3. **White's Plan**:
   - White will use the rook to deliver checks and force the Black king into a corner (h8 or h7).
   - The g-pawn can also be used to restrict the Black king's movement.

4. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:
   - Black's first move is irrelevant to the outcome, as White's rook will immediately start delivering checks.
   - White's rook will force the Black king to h8, where it will be checkmated by the pawn.

5. **Verification**:
   - Each move in the sequence is checked to ensure legality and that it leads to a forced mate in 4 moves.
