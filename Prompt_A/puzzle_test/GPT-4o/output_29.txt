--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - White is to move and has a strong attacking position.
   - The black king is on g8, and its escape routes are limited due to its own pieces and White's control of key squares.
   - White's queen on h6 and rook on e8 are well-placed for delivering checks and coordinating a mating attack.
   - Black's knight on e4 and bishop on f8 are defensive pieces, but they are not sufficient to prevent a forced mate.

2. **Candidate Moves**:
   - The most forcing move is 1. Rxf8+, as it immediately checks the black king and forces a response.
   - Other moves like 1. Ne6+ or 1. Qxf8+ are less forcing or do not lead to a quick mate.

3. **Black's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1. Rxf8+, Black must recapture with 1... Kxf8, as no other move is legal.
   - This brings the black king to f8, where it is more exposed.

4. **Continuation**:
   - After 1... Kxf8, White can play 2. Ba3+, a discovered check using the bishop on b2.
   - Black's only legal move is 2... Qxa3, capturing the bishop.

5. **Final Move**:
   - White finishes with 3. Bxa3#, delivering checkmate with the bishop on a3.

6. **Verification**:
   - Each move in the sequence is forcing, and Black has no alternatives to avoid checkmate.
   - The sequence is a clean mate in 3 moves.
