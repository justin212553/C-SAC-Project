1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White's king is on g2, and White has a rook on g4 and a knight on e4.
   - Black's king is on h8, and Black has a rook on f8 and pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - White's rook on g4 can deliver a check by moving to g8.
   - White's knight on e4 can deliver a check by moving to g5 or f6.
   - Other moves do not deliver check or checkmate.

3. **Evaluation of Rg8**:
   - If White plays 1. Rg8#, the Black king on h8 has no legal moves, and no other Black piece can block or capture the rook. This is a checkmate.

4. **Evaluation of Ng5 and Nf6**:
   - Both knight moves deliver a check, but they are not checkmate because the Black king can escape to h7.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only move that delivers a forced checkmate in one move is 1. Rg8#.
