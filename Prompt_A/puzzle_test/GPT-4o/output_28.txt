--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - Black is to move.
   - White's king is on h2, and Black's king is on h5.
   - Black has a queen on g7 and a rook on c2, while White has a queen on e4 and a rook on f1.
   - Black's f2 pawn is close to promotion but cannot advance immediately due to White's control of the f-file.

2. **Objective**:
   - Black must deliver a forced checkmate in 3 moves.

3. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - Black's queen and rook are the primary attacking pieces. The goal is to coordinate them to trap White's king on the h-file.
   - The White king has limited mobility due to its position on h2 and the surrounding pieces.

4. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:
   - **Move 1**: Black plays 1... Qg2+.
     - This forces White's king to move to h1, as it is the only legal move.
   - **Move 2**: Black plays 2... Rc1+.
     - This forces White to block the check with 3. Qe1, as it is the only legal move.
   - **Move 3**: Black plays 3... Rxe1#.
     - The rook captures the queen on e1, delivering checkmate. The White king on h1 is completely trapped.

5. **Verification**:
   - Each move is forced, and the sequence leads to a checkmate in 3 moves.
   - The solution is correct and satisfies the "Mate in 3" condition.
