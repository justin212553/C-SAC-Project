1. Analyze the position: It is Black's turn to move. The Black king is on e3, and the Black pawn is on f2. The White king is on f1. Black needs to deliver a checkmate in one move.

2. Key candidate moves:
   - The Black pawn on f2 can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Each promotion must be evaluated to determine if it results in a checkmate.
   - Promoting to a queen (f1=Q) delivers check to the White king on f1. The White king has no legal moves, as all adjacent squares are controlled by the Black king or the newly promoted queen. This results in checkmate.
   - Promoting to a rook (f1=R) also delivers checkmate, as the rook controls the f-file and the first rank, leaving the White king with no escape.
   - Promoting to a bishop (f1=B) does not deliver checkmate, as the White king is not in check.
   - Promoting to a knight (f1=N) does not deliver checkmate, as the White king is not in check.

3. Forced responses: Since the White king has no legal moves after f1=Q or f1=R, these moves result in immediate checkmate.

4. Conclusion: The solution is to promote the pawn on f2 to either a queen or a rook. Both moves are valid, but the most common and straightforward choice is to promote to a queen.
