1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5.
   - Black's king is on g8, and there are no other black pieces that can block or capture.
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Candidate Moves**:
   - The rook on e5 can deliver checks along the 5th rank or the e-file. 
   - The move **Re8#** is a direct checkmate because:
     - The black king on g8 is attacked by the rook on e8.
     - The black king has no escape squares (f8, f7, g7, h7, h8 are all unavailable due to the rook and the white king's control).

3. **Verification**:
   - No other move by White delivers checkmate in one move.
   - The move **Re8#** is legal and forces an immediate checkmate.
