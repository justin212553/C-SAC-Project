1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White has a significant material advantage with a rook, bishop, and pawns against Black's lone king.
   - The Black king is on a6, and White's pieces are well-positioned to deliver a checkmate.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - White's rook on h7 can move to h6, delivering a checkmate. The Black king on a6 has no escape squares due to the combined control of squares by the rook, bishop, and pawns.

3. **Verification**:
   - After 1. Rh6#, the Black king on a6 is in check and cannot move to any square:
     - The rook on h6 controls the entire 6th rank.
     - The bishop on g4 controls b5 and c8.
     - The pawns on c4 and b4 block b5 and b6.
   - This confirms that 1. Rh6# is a forced mate in 1.
