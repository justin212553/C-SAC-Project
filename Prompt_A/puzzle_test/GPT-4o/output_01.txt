1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White has a queen on f2, a bishop on g3, and a knight on g2. The king is on f1.
   - Black's king is on h1, and there are no other black pieces on the board.
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The white queen on f2 can move to h2, delivering checkmate. The black king on h1 has no escape squares because:
     - The white bishop on g3 controls the f2 and h2 squares.
     - The white knight on g2 controls the f4 and h4 squares.
     - The white queen on h2 would directly attack the black king, and no other black pieces exist to block or capture the queen.

3. **Verification**:
   - The move Qh2# is legal and delivers checkmate. The black king has no legal moves, and there are no pieces to block or capture the attacking queen.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution is 1. Qh2#.
