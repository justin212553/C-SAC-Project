1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in 2 moves.
   - White has a strong attacking position with the rook on h5, the bishop on f6, and the rook on f3. Black's king is exposed on e4, and Black's pieces are poorly coordinated.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - White's primary goal is to deliver a forced checkmate in 2 moves. The most forcing moves are checks.
   - Candidate moves include:
     - 1. Re5+ (a direct check with the rook).
     - 1. Rh4+ (a check with the rook from h5).
   - Other moves like moving the bishop or rook without a check do not seem to lead to a forced mate in 2.

3. **Analysis of 1. Re5+**:
   - If 1. Re5+, Black's king has only one legal move: 1...Kxf3.
   - After 2. Bh4#, White delivers checkmate with the bishop. The Black king is trapped, and no Black piece can block or capture the bishop.

4. **Analysis of 1. Rh4+**:
   - If 1. Rh4+, Black's king has multiple escape squares (e.g., 1...Kf3 or 1...Ke3), and White cannot deliver mate in 2. This move is not forcing enough.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The move 1. Re5+ is the correct first move, leading to a forced mate in 2.
