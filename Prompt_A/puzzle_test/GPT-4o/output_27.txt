--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - White is to move and has a significant material advantage, with a queen and rook against Black's rook and pawns.
   - Black's king is on h7, and White's queen and rook are well-positioned to deliver checks.
   - The goal is to find a forced mate in 3 moves.

2. **Candidate Moves**:
   - White's queen and rook can coordinate to deliver checks and restrict the Black king's movement.
   - The move 1. Qg8+ is a forcing move, as it puts the Black king in check and limits its options.

3. **Black's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1. Qg8+, Black's king must move to h8 (the only legal move).
   - White can then play 2. f8=Q+, promoting the pawn to a queen and delivering another check.
   - Black's only response to 2. f8=Q+ is to block with 2... Qg7.

4. **Final Move**:
   - White can then deliver checkmate with 3. Qgxg7#.

5. **Verification**:
   - Each move in the sequence is forcing, and Black has no alternative responses.
   - The sequence ends in checkmate on the third move.
