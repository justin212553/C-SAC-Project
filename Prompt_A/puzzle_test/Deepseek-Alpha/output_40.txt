--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - Black to move.
   - White's queen on b7 is very active and threatening.
   - Black's king is on e8, and the position is cramped with limited mobility.
   - Black has a strong attacking potential with the queen on g6 and the bishop on g4, but White's threats are overwhelming.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - Black must focus on forcing White's king into a vulnerable position or delivering direct checks.
   - The move 1... Nc2+ is a forcing check that drives White's king into a corner or forces a block.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1... Nc2+, White has limited options: either move the king or block with the rook or bishop.
   - Each response leads to a sequence of forced moves culminating in checkmate.

4. **Sequence Verification**:
   - The sequence must ensure that every move is a check, leaving no room for White to deviate.
   - The final move must deliver checkmate in exactly 4 moves.

5. **Solution**:
   - The solution involves precise coordination between Black's knight, queen, and bishop to deliver a forced mate.
