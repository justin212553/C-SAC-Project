--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Initial Position Analysis**:
   - White is to move and has a significant attacking advantage with active pieces, particularly the rooks, bishops, and knight.
   - Black's king is on e8, surrounded by its own pieces, limiting its mobility.
   - The black pieces are poorly coordinated, and the king is vulnerable to a forced checkmate sequence.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - White's immediate threats involve delivering checks with the rooks, bishops, or knight to force the black king into a vulnerable position.
   - The move 1. Rc8+ is a strong candidate, as it forces the black king to move to d7 (the only legal move).

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1. Rc8+, Black's king must move to d7.
   - White can then follow up with 2. Bg4#, but this is not a mate in 4. Instead, White should aim to use the knight and bishops to restrict the black king further.

4. **Refining the Sequence**:
   - After 1. Rc8+ Kd7, White can play 2. Nxb6+ to force the black king to c6.
   - From there, White can deliver a decisive checkmate using the bishops and rooks.

5. **Verification**:
   - Each move in the sequence must be checked to ensure legality and that it leads to a forced mate in 4.
   - The final move must deliver checkmate, with no escape for the black king.
