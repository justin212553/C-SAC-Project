--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Position Analysis**:  
   Black to move. The position is highly tactical, with Black's pieces (bishop on c5, knight on h4, and rook on g2) creating threats. White's king is on h1, and Black's bishop and knight can coordinate to deliver checkmate. The goal is to find a forced mate in 3 moves.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   Black's rook on g2 and knight on h4 are well-placed to deliver checks. The bishop on c5 can also contribute to the attack. The first move must force White's king into a vulnerable position or restrict its mobility further.

3. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:  
   - **Move 1**: Black plays 1... Rg1+. This forces White's king to move to h2 (the only legal move).  
   - **Move 2**: Black plays 2... Nf3+. This is a double check from the knight and rook, forcing White's king to move to h3 (again, the only legal move).  
   - **Move 3**: Black plays 3... Bc8#. The bishop delivers checkmate, as the White king on h3 is completely surrounded and has no escape squares.

4. **Verification**:  
   Each move in the sequence is forced, and the final position results in checkmate. The solution is correct and satisfies the "mate in 3" condition.
