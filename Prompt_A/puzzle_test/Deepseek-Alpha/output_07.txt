1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in one move.
   - The black king is on h8, and the black rook is on f8. Both pieces are confined to the back rank.
   - White has a rook on g4 and a knight on e4, both positioned to attack the black king.

2. **Candidate Moves**:
   - White's rook on g4 can move to g8, delivering check. This move is promising because it forces the black king into a position where it cannot escape.
   - Other moves, such as moving the knight or king, do not deliver checkmate in one move.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - If White plays 1. Rg8#, the black king on h8 has no legal moves, and the black rook on f8 cannot block the check. This results in immediate checkmate.

4. **Verification**:
   - The move 1. Rg8# is legal and leads to a forced checkmate. No other moves achieve the goal of mate in one.
