1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White has a clear advantage with multiple attacking pieces: the rook on h7, bishop on g4, and pawns on c5, c4, and b4.
   - Black's king is on a6, and there are no other black pieces on the board. This means Black has no defensive resources to block or escape checks.

2. **Goal**: 
   - White must deliver a forced checkmate in one move.

3. **Candidate Moves**:
   - White's rook on h7 can deliver a check by moving to h6, but this is not a checkmate as the Black king can escape to b5.
   - White's bishop on g4 can deliver a check by moving to c8, but this is not a checkmate as the Black king can escape to b5.
   - White's rook on h7 can move to h8, delivering a checkmate because the Black king on a6 is completely trapped and has no legal moves.

4. **Verification**:
   - After 1. Rh8#, the Black king on a6 is surrounded:
     - The pawns on b4 and c5 block escape to b5 and b6.
     - The bishop on g4 controls the b5 square.
     - The rook on h8 controls the entire 8th rank, preventing escape to b7 or b8.
   - This confirms that 1. Rh8# is a forced checkmate.
