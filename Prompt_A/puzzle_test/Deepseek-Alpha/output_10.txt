1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - Black is to move. The position is an endgame scenario with only kings and pawns remaining.  
   - Black's king is on e3, and Black has pawns on f2 and e4. White's king is on f1.  
   - The goal is to deliver checkmate in one move.  

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   - Black's pawns can potentially move forward, but only one move results in a checkmate.  
   - The move **f2-f1=Q#** promotes the pawn on f2 to a queen, delivering checkmate.  

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:  
   - After **f2-f1=Q#**, White's king on f1 is in check and has no legal moves.  
   - The promotion to a queen covers all escape squares for the White king (e.g., e2, g2, g1).  

4. **Verification**:  
   - The move **f2-f1=Q#** is legal and results in immediate checkmate.  
   - No other moves by Black achieve checkmate in one move.
