1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - Black to move.  
   - The black king is on b5, and the white king is on g1.  
   - Black has a rook on e4, while White has pawns on f2, g2, and h2.  
   - The goal is to deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   - The black rook on e4 can deliver a check by moving to squares where the white king cannot escape.  
   - The white king on g1 is surrounded by pawns and has no escape squares.  
   - The move **Re1#** is a forced checkmate because:  
     - The rook on e1 checks the white king.  
     - The white king cannot move to f1, h1, or h2 due to the pawns blocking those squares.  
     - The white king cannot capture the rook on e1 because it is out of reach.  
     - No other white pieces can block the check or capture the rook.

3. **Verification**:  
   - The move **Re1#** is legal and results in immediate checkmate.  
   - No other moves by Black deliver checkmate in one move.
