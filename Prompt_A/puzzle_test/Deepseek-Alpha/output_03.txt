1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - White has a rook on e5, a king on b4, and no other pieces. Black's king is on g8, with pawns on g7, h7, and f7.
   - White is to move and must deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The rook on e5 can deliver checks by moving to e8, e7, or e6. However, only one move results in a forced checkmate.
   - Moving the rook to e8 directly attacks the black king on g8, and the black king has no escape squares due to its own pawns blocking g7, h7, and f7.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1. Re8#, the black king is completely surrounded and cannot move to any square. This results in an immediate checkmate.

4. **Verification**:
   - All other moves fail to deliver checkmate in one move. For example, 1. Re7+ allows the black king to escape to h8, and 1. Re6+ allows the black king to move to f8.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only move that satisfies the condition of "Mate in 1" is 1. Re8#.
