--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Position Analysis**:  
   Black is to move, and the position is highly tactical. Black has a strong attack with the queen and rooks, while White's king is exposed on g1. Black's pieces are well-coordinated, and the goal is to deliver a forced checkmate in 3 moves.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   - Black's queen on d5 and rook on f6 are ideally placed to deliver checks and control key squares.  
   - The rook on f6 can move to f1, delivering a check and forcing White's king to move.  
   - The queen can then deliver decisive checks, leading to mate.  

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:  
   - White's king has limited mobility due to Black's control of key squares.  
   - White's pieces (rook on c2 and pawns) cannot effectively defend against the attack.  

4. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:  
   - **Move 1**: Black plays 1...Rf1+, forcing White's king to move to g2 (the only legal move).  
   - **Move 2**: Black plays 2...Qxd4+, delivering a check and forcing White's king to move to h3 (again, the only legal move).  
   - **Move 3**: Black plays 3...Qh4#, delivering checkmate as the White king is trapped and cannot escape.  

5. **Verification**:  
   - Each move is legal and forces White's responses.  
   - The sequence ends in checkmate on the third move, fulfilling the puzzle's requirement.
