1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - White is to move. The black king is on a7, and the black queen is on h7. Black has limited mobility due to the white pieces dominating key squares.  
   - White has a strong attacking position with the rook on c8, queen on f6, and bishop on g5. The pawn on e5 can also be used to restrict black's king movement.  

2. **Goal**:  
   - White must deliver checkmate in 3 moves. This requires forcing the black king into a position where it cannot escape checks or block them effectively.  

3. **Candidate Moves**:  
   - The white rook on c8 can deliver a check on c7, forcing the black king to move.  
   - The white queen on f6 can deliver checks on squares like d8 or b6, depending on the position.  
   - The bishop on g5 can also be used to control key squares.  

4. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:  
   - **Move 1**: White plays 1. Rc7+. This forces the black king to move to a6 (the only legal move).  
   - **Move 2**: White plays 2. Be3+. This check forces the black king to move to b5 (again, the only legal move).  
   - **Move 3**: White plays 3. Qb6#. This delivers checkmate as the black king is completely surrounded and has no escape squares.  

5. **Verification**:  
   - Each move is legal and forces the black king into a progressively worse position, culminating in checkmate on the third move.
