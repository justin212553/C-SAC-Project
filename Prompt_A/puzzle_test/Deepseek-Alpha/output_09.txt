1. **Position Analysis**: The FEN indicates White is to move, and the position consists of White's king on e6, pawns on f6 and f5, and Black's king on f8. The goal is to deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - White has only one pawn move available: f7+.
   - This move places the Black king in check and simultaneously blocks all escape squares (e7, e8, g7, g8) due to the White king's control and the pawn's placement.

3. **Opponent's Forced Response**:
   - After f7+, the Black king has no legal moves. This results in immediate checkmate.

4. **Verification**:
   - The move f7+ is legal and leads directly to checkmate.
   - No other moves by White achieve checkmate in one move.
