--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - Black to move. The white king is on e5, and black has several attacking pieces: the rook on h4, rook on f6, and bishop on f3.  
   - White's king is exposed, and black can deliver a forced checkmate in 2 moves by coordinating the rooks and bishop.  

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   - Black's rook on h4 can deliver a check on h5, forcing the white king to move.  
   - The white king has only one legal move after Rh5+: Ke6.  
   - After Ke6, black can deliver checkmate with the rook on f6 moving to f5 (Rf5#).  

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:  
   - After Rh5+, white's king is forced to move to e6 (Ke6).  
   - Black's follow-up move Rf5# is unavoidable and leads to checkmate.  

4. **Verification**:  
   - All moves are legal and lead to a forced mate in 2.  
   - No other black moves achieve checkmate in 2 moves.
