--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - White is to move and has a significant advantage due to active pieces, particularly the rook on g7 and the knight on h5.  
   - Black's king is on h8, surrounded by limited escape squares. The bishop on g6 is a key defender, and the rook on f8 provides some protection.  
   - White's goal is to deliver checkmate in 3 moves, exploiting the coordination of the rook, knight, and bishop.

2. **Candidate Moves**:  
   - The knight on h5 can deliver a check on f6, forcing Black's king to move or the bishop to capture.  
   - The rook on g7 can deliver checks along the g-file, but Black's bishop on g6 blocks direct access.  
   - The bishop on c4 can potentially join the attack, but immediate checks with the knight and rook seem more forcing.

3. **Move-by-Move Analysis**:  
   - **Move 1**: White plays 1. Nf6+. This is a forcing move, as it puts the Black king in check. Black has only one legal response: 1... Bxf6.  
   - **Move 2**: White plays 2. Bxf6+. This check removes the defender (bishop) and forces Black's king to move to h7.  
   - **Move 3**: White plays 3. Rg8#. The rook delivers checkmate, as the Black king is trapped with no escape squares.

4. **Verification**:  
   - Each move is forcing, and Black has no alternative responses. The sequence leads to a guaranteed checkmate in 3 moves.
