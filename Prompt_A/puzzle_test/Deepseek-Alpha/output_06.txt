--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **Position Analysis**: 
   - Black is to move, and the goal is to deliver checkmate in one move.
   - The black king is on a8, and the white king is on a3. Black has pawns on b5 and c4, a bishop on g5, and a rook on h2. White has no immediate threats, and the position is set for a decisive move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - Black's rook on h2 can deliver a checkmate by moving to h3. This move places the white king in check, and there are no legal moves for White to escape the checkmate:
     - The white king on a3 cannot move to b3 or b4 due to the black pawns on b5 and c4.
     - The white king cannot move to a4 due to the black bishop on g5.
     - The white king cannot capture the rook on h3 because it is protected by the black bishop on g5.

3. **Verification**:
   - All other moves fail to deliver checkmate in one move. For example:
     - Moving the bishop does not result in immediate checkmate.
     - Moving the pawns does not lead to a forced mate.
   - Therefore, the only move that satisfies the condition is **Rh3#**.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The move Rh3# is a forced checkmate in one move.
