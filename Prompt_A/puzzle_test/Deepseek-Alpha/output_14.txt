1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - Black to move. The position is highly favorable for Black, with White's king on a3 exposed and limited mobility. Black's pieces (rook on e8 and rook on f7) are well-placed to deliver checks and control key squares.  
   - White's pawns and king are unable to defend effectively, and Black has a clear opportunity to deliver a forced mate in 2 moves.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:  
   - Black's rooks can deliver checks and control escape squares for White's king. The move 1... Ra7+ is a strong candidate, as it forces White's king to move to b4 (the only legal move).  
   - After 1... Ra7+, White's king is further restricted, and Black can deliver the final blow with 2... Rb8#, checkmating the White king.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:  
   - After 1... Ra7+, White's king has no choice but to move to b4.  
   - After 2... Rb8#, White's king is completely trapped, and the checkmate is unavoidable.

4. **Verification**:  
   - All moves are legal and lead to the desired checkmate in 2 moves.  
   - The sequence is forced, with no alternative defenses for White.
