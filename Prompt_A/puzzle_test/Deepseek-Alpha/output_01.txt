1. **Position Analysis**: The FEN indicates that White has a queen on f2, a bishop on g3, and a knight on g2, while Black's king is on h1. White is to move, and the goal is to deliver checkmate in one move.

2. **Key Candidate Moves**:
   - The White queen can move to h2, delivering checkmate. This is because the Black king on h1 has no escape squares, and the move places the king in check.
   - Other moves, such as moving the bishop or knight, do not deliver checkmate in one move.

3. **Opponent's Forced Responses**:
   - After 1. Qh2#, the Black king is in check and has no legal moves. The h1 square is attacked by the queen, and all adjacent squares (g1, g2) are either occupied or controlled by White's pieces.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The move 1. Qh2# is the only move that satisfies the condition of a forced checkmate in one move.
