1. **White to move**: Analyze all possible moves for White.
2. **Pieces to consider**:
   - Queen on e6
   - Knight on d5
   - Rook on d1
   - Rook on f1
   - Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2
3. **Legal moves**:
   - The Queen on e6 can move to several squares, including capturing on f6 (Qxf6+), which delivers check.
   - The Knight on d5 can move to several squares, but none of them deliver immediate threats.
   - The Rook on d1 can move along the d-file, but no immediate threats are created.
   - The Rook on f1 can move along the f-file, but no immediate threats are created.
   - Pawns can move forward, but no immediate threats are created.
4. **Best move**:
   - Qxf6+ is the strongest move, as it delivers check to the Black king and forces a response.
