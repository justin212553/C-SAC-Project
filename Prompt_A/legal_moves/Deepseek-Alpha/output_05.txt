1. **White to move**: The position is analyzed based on the FEN provided: **8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1**.
2. **White's pieces**: White has a king on a1, a rook on h7, a bishop on g4, and pawns on c4, c5, and b4.
3. **Legal moves**:
   - **King (a1)**: The king cannot move as it is surrounded by the board's edge and its own pawns.
   - **Rook (h7)**: The rook can move along the h-file or the 7th rank. For example, Rh8+ is a legal move, delivering check to the black king on a6.
   - **Bishop (g4)**: The bishop can move diagonally. For example, Bc8 is a legal move.
   - **Pawn (b4)**: The pawn can advance to b5.
   - **Pawn (c4)**: The pawn can advance to c5.
   - **Pawn (c5)**: The pawn can advance to c6.
4. **Best move**: Among the legal moves, Rh8+ is the most forcing move as it delivers check to the black king.
