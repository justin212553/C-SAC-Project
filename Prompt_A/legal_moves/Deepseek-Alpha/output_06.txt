1. **Analyze the position**:
   - It is Black's turn to move.
   - Black has the following pieces: a king on a8, a bishop on g5, a pawn on c5, a pawn on c4, and a rook on h2.
   - White has a king on a3.

2. **Legal moves for Black**:
   - The black king on a8 can move to b8 or b7.
   - The black bishop on g5 can move to several squares: h4, f4, e3, d2, c1, f6, h6.
   - The black pawn on c5 can move to c4 (capture is not possible as the square is occupied by another black pawn).
   - The black pawn on c4 cannot move forward as it is blocked.
   - The black rook on h2 can move along the h-file or the second rank.

3. **Choose one legal move**:
   - For simplicity, I will select the move **Rh3**, where the rook moves from h2 to h3.
