--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Analyze the position from the FEN: **8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1**.
2. It is Black's turn to move. The only Black piece on the board is the rook on e4.
3. The rook can move horizontally or vertically, as long as it stays within the bounds of the board and does not land on a square occupied by another Black piece (none exist here).
4. Possible legal moves for the rook:
   - Horizontally: e1, e2, e3, e5, e6, e7, e8.
   - Vertically: a4, b4, c4, d4, f4, g4, h4.
5. Any of these moves is legal. For simplicity, we will choose one move: **Re1**.
