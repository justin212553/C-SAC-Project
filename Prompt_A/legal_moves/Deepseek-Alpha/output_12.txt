1. **Side to move**: Black (b).
2. **Analyze all moveable pieces**:
   - Black has the following pieces: King (c3), Queen (d3), and Bishop (d4).
3. **Legal moves**:
   - **King (c3)**: The king can move to b2, b3, b4, c2, d2, or d4. However, c2 and d4 are illegal due to being under attack by White's pieces.
   - **Queen (d3)**: The queen can move to any square along the d-file (d1, d2, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8), the 3rd rank (a3, b3, c3, e3, f3, g3, h3), or diagonals (a6, b5, c4, e4, f5, g6, h7). All these moves are legal.
   - **Bishop (d4)**: The bishop can move along its diagonals to c3, b2, a1, e3, f2, g1, c5, b6, a7, e5, f6, g7, or h8. All these moves are legal.
4. **Choose one legal move**:
   - For simplicity, I will select the move **Qxa6**, where the black queen captures the rook on a6.
