1. **White to move**: Analyze all possible moves for White.
   - The position shows White has the following pieces: King (a4), Queen (f6), Rook (c8), and Bishop (g5).
   - Black's King is on a7, and there are other Black pieces (Rook on f7, Queen on h7, and Bishop on f2).

2. **Legal moves for White**:
   - **King (a4)**: The King cannot move as all adjacent squares are either occupied or under attack.
   - **Queen (f6)**: The Queen has multiple options, including capturing on f7 (Qxf7+), moving along the f-file, or moving along the diagonal.
   - **Rook (c8)**: The Rook can move along the c-file or the 8th rank. Notably, Rc7+ is a check.
   - **Bishop (g5)**: The Bishop can move along its diagonals. However, Bg5-e3 or Bg5-d2 are not impactful compared to other moves.

3. **Best move**:
   - The move Qxf7+ is a strong candidate as it puts the Black King in check and simplifies the position.
   - Rc7+ is another check, but it does not lead to immediate progress.
   - Other moves do not create a check or significant advantage.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The best move is Qxf7+, delivering check to the Black King.
