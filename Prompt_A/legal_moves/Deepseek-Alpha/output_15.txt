1. **White to move**: Analyze all possible moves for White.
   - White's pieces: King (d1), Rook (f3), Rook (h5), Bishop (f6), and pawns (a3, b3, g3, h2).
   - Black's pieces: King (e4), Rook (e8), Rook (a8), Knight (d6), and pawns (a7, b6, d3).

2. **Legal moves for White**:
   - **King (d1)**: Cannot move due to being surrounded by its own pieces or moving into check.
   - **Rook (f3)**: Can move to f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, e3, d3, c3, b3, or a3.
   - **Rook (h5)**: Can move to h6, h7, h8, g5, f5, e5, d5, or c5.
   - **Bishop (f6)**: Can move to g5, h4, e5, d4, c3, b2, or a1.
   - **Pawn (a3)**: Can move to a4.
   - **Pawn (b3)**: Can move to b4.
   - **Pawn (g3)**: Can move to g4.
   - **Pawn (h2)**: Can move to h3 or h4.

3. **Best move**:
   - After evaluating all legal moves, the move **Rook h5 to h4** is a strong candidate. It puts pressure on Black's pawn on d3 and maintains control of the position.
