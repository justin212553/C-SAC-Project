To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given FEN position: **6kn/5p1p/6p1/2B1P3/1P2P3/5P2/2r3PP/R5K1 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- **6kn**: The eighth rank (black's starting rank) has a king on the g-file, a knight on the h-file, and is empty on the rest of the files.
- **5p1p**: The seventh rank has pawns on the f-file and h-file.
- **6p1**: The sixth rank has a pawn on the g-file.
- **2B1P3**: The fifth rank has a white bishop on the c-file and a pawn on the e-file.
- **1P2P3**: The fourth rank has a white pawn on the b-file and another on the e-file.
- **5P2**: The third rank has a white pawn on the f-file.
- **2r3PP**: The second rank has a black rook on the c-file, and white pawns on the g-file and h-file.
- **R5K1**: The first rank (white's starting rank) has a white rook on the a-file and a white king on the g-file.

The position is white's turn to move, as indicated by 'w'. There are no en passant captures available ('-'), and there are no half-moves since the last capture or pawn move ('0'). This is the first move of the game from this position ('1').

Let's analyze the pieces:
- White King (Kg1): Can potentially move to f1, f2, h1, or h2, but needs to be checked for legality.
- White Rook (Ra1): Can potentially move along the a-file or along the first rank.
- White Bishop (Bc5): Can potentially move along the diagonal it's on.
- White Pawns: The pawns on b4, e4, f3, g2, and h2 can potentially move forward one or two squares, depending on their current position.

Let's check the legality of potential moves for the white pieces:
- The White King is on g1. It can move to f2, h1, or h2. Moving to f1 is not possible because it's not adjacent to g1. So, Kg1-f2, Kg1-h1, and Kg1-h2 are potential moves.
- The White Rook on a1 can move along the a-file. It can capture the black Rook on c2 if it moves to c1 (but c1 is not directly accessible because it's blocked by other pieces or not on the same rank/file without checking further), or it can potentially move to a2, a3, etc., until it's blocked by a piece. Ra1-a2 is a potential move since a2 is empty.
- The White Bishop on c5 is somewhat restricted. It can move along the diagonal it's on (a3-f8). Potential moves include Be3, Bd4 (if d4 were empty, which it is not directly because of the pawn on e4, but we can consider it), Bb6, Ba7. However, most of these moves are blocked or not directly relevant.
- White Pawns: 
  - b4 can potentially move to b5.
  - e4 can potentially move to e5.
  - f3 can potentially move to f4.
  - g2 can potentially move to g3 or g4.
  - h2 can potentially move to h3 or h4.

Let's directly examine a simple and clear move:
- The White Rook can move to a2 (Ra1-a2) or potentially other places along the a-file or first rank if not blocked or if capturing.

Let's directly check a straightforward move: **Ra1-a2**. This is a valid move as the Rook can move to an adjacent square on the same file.

The PGN for this move is **1.Ra2**.
