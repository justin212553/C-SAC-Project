To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k2 w - - 0 1** is not the given FEN, the given FEN is **4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1**. We need to understand the position based on this FEN.

Breaking down the FEN:
- **4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8**: This part describes the position of the pieces on the board.
  - The board is described in rows from the top (Black's side) to the bottom (White's side).
  - **4r3**: Black has a Rook on e8.
  - **5r2**: Black has a Rook on f7.
  - **3p1p2**: Black has pawns on d6 and f6.
  - **1P6**: White has a pawn on b5.
  - **8**: An empty row.
  - **K1p5**: White has a King on a3 and a Black pawn (mistakenly noted as White) on c3. It should be interpreted as White King on a3 and Black pawn on c3.
  - **P1k5**: White has a pawn on a2 and Black King on c2.
  - **8**: An empty row.
- **b**: It's Black's turn to move.
- **-**: The "en passant" target is not available.
- **-**: There are no half-move clock indications.
- **0**: The number of moves since the last capture or pawn move is 0.
- **1**: The current move number is 1.

Let's analyze the position:
- Black's pieces: King on c2, Rooks on e8 and f7, pawns on c3, d6, and f6.
- White's pieces: King on a3, pawn on a2 and b5.

Given it's Black's turn, let's consider the possible moves:
1. **King (c2)**: Can move to b1, b2, or d1, d2, or d3 because it's on c2. Moving to b2 is not possible because it's occupied by the same color pawn (if we were considering a White pawn, but here it's a Black pawn on c3). So, potential moves are Kb1 or Kd1.
2. **Rooks**: 
   - The Rook on e8 can potentially move along the e-file or along the 8th rank. However, there are no White pieces on the e-file or the 8th rank to capture, and it's not clear if it can move to a more advantageous position without putting the King in danger or achieving a specific goal. It can move to e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, or e7.
   - The Rook on f7 can move along the f-file or the 7th rank. It can potentially move to f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, or f8 (though f8 is occupied by the other Rook, so not a valid move without considering other factors).
3. **Pawns**:
   - The pawn on c3 is blocked by the White King indirectly but can potentially move to c2 (not possible because it's occupied by the Black King) or capture if there were a piece on b2 or d2. It's actually blocked and can't move forward but could potentially capture if White had a piece on b2.
   - The pawn on d6 can move to d5.
   - The pawn on f6 can move to f5.

Let's directly check for valid moves:
- **1... Kd1** is a valid move as the King can move to d1.
- Other valid moves could be with the Rooks or pawns.

Let's directly analyze a simple and valid move:
- The Black King can move from c2 to d1.

Now, let's directly provide the PGN for a valid move.

1... Kd1
