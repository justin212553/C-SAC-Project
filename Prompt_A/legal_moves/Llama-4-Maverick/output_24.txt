To analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **b2N2k1/6pp/p7/2b5/2p4n/1P3PB1/P5rP/R4R1K b - - 0 1**, let's first understand what the FEN notation tells us and then examine the position.

1. **Understanding FEN**: 
   - The position is: `b2N2k1/6pp/p7/2b5/2p4n/1P3PB1/P5rP/R4R1K b - - 0 1`.
   - Breaking it down:
     - `b2N2k1`: Black bishop, 2 empty squares, White knight, 2 empty squares, Black king, 1 empty square.
     - `6pp`: 6 empty squares, Black pawn, Black pawn.
     - `p7`: Black pawn, 7 empty squares.
     - `2b5`: 2 empty squares, Black bishop, 5 empty squares.
     - `2p4n`: 2 empty squares, Black pawn, 4 empty squares, Black knight.
     - `1P3PB1`: 1 empty square, White pawn, 3 empty squares, White pawn, White bishop, 1 empty square.
     - `P5rP`: White pawn, 5 empty squares, Black rook, White pawn.
     - `R4R1K`: White rook, 4 empty squares, White rook, 1 empty square, White king.
     - `b`: It's Black's turn.
     - `-`: The previous move was not a double pawn push (relevant for en passant).
     - `-`: There's no ongoing capture sequence for the 50-move rule.
     - `0`: Halfmove count for the 50-move rule is reset.
     - `1`: The current move number is 1.

2. **Analyzing the Position**:
   - Black is to move. The Black king is on `f8`, and it's not in check.
   - Let's analyze the moveable pieces for Black:
     - Black bishop on `c5` can potentially move.
     - Black pawn on `g7` can potentially move.
     - Black pawn on `a6` is blocked by the White pawn on `b3` indirectly but can potentially move if there's a valid square.
     - Black knight on `h4` can potentially move.
     - Black rook on `g2` can potentially move.

3. **Checking Possible Moves**:
   - The Black bishop on `c5` can move to `d4`, `e3`, `d6`, `e7`, `b4`, `b6`, `a3`, or `a7` if not blocked or capturing. It can capture the White bishop on `g3` or potentially move to other squares if they are valid.
   - The Black pawn on `g7` can move to `g6` or `g5`.
   - The Black knight on `h4` can move to `f5`, `f3`, or `g6` if those squares are valid.
   - The Black rook on `g2` can move along the second rank or potentially capture on `g3` if it were not for the White bishop.

4. **Finding a Valid Move**:
   - Upon closer inspection, one of the simplest valid moves is to be made by the Black pawn on `g7`. It can move to `g6` or `g5`. Let's check if `g6` is a valid move. There's no piece on `g6`, so `g7-g6` or `g7g6` in PGN notation is a valid move.
   - Another potential move could involve the Black knight or the bishop. However, we need to identify a move that is straightforward and valid.

5. **PGN Notation for the Move**:
   - The move `g7-g6` in PGN is written as `g6`.

Let's directly check if `1... g6` is a valid move.

[FINAL PGN]
1... g6
[/FINAL PGN] is not valid due to the extra text, the correct format is:

[FINAL PGN]
1... g6
[/FINAL PGN] -> should be just 1... g6

The final answer is:
[FINAL PGN]
1... g6
