To solve this problem, let's analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **8/8/8/8/8/6B1/5QN1/5K1k w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The White King is on f1, the White Queen is on f2, and the White Knight is on g2.
- The White Bishop is on g3.
- The Black King is on h1.

The task is to find a legal move for White.

Let's examine the pieces:
1. **White King (f1):** It can move to e1, e2, or g1, as these are the adjacent squares not occupied by other White pieces or under attack by Black pieces (though we are not considering Black's moves, we note that the Black King is on h1 and not directly attacking f1). So, Ke1, Ke2, or Kg1 are potential moves.
   
2. **White Queen (f2):** The Queen has various potential moves (e.g., along the f-file, or along the second rank, or diagonally). Let's check some: Qe1#, Qg1#, Qh4+, Qe3, Qd4, etc. We need to check for checks or checkmates.

3. **White Knight (g2):** The Knight can potentially move to e1, e3, f4, or h4. Let's check these: Ne1, Ne3, Nf4, Nh4.

4. **White Bishop (g3):** The Bishop can potentially move along the diagonals it's on. So, it can move to f2, h2, f4, h4, etc. Let's check: Bf2+, Bh2+, Bf4, Bh4.

Let's directly check for checkmate or a straightforward move:
- **Qg1#** is a checkmate as the Queen moving to g1 puts the Black King in check with no legal moves to escape the check. The Black King is on h1, and Kg1 is not a valid move for the Black King as it's occupied by a potential White piece, but more importantly, Qg1# directly checkmates.

Let's verify if **Qg1#** is a valid move:
- The White Queen is on f2, and moving to g1 is a diagonal move, which is valid for a Queen.

Therefore, a valid and checkmating move is **1. Qg1#**.
