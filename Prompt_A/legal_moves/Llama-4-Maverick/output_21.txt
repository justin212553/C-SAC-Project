To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given FEN position: **r5k1/2r4p/4pRpP/qP1p4/3Q2P1/5R2/1P6/1K6 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- **r5k1/2r4p/4pRpP/qP1p4/3Q2P1/5R2/1P6/1K6**: This part describes the pieces on the board, row by row, from Black's perspective (8th row to 1st row).
  - **r5k1**: Black's Rook, empty squares, King, and a Pawn on the 8th row.
  - **2r4p**: Black's Rook, empty squares, and a Pawn on the 7th row.
  - **4pRpP**: Empty squares, Black's Pawn, White's Rook, Black's Pawn on the 6th row.
  - **qP1p4**: Black's Queen, White's Pawn, empty square, Black's Pawn, empty squares on the 5th row.
  - **3Q2P1**: Empty squares, White's Queen, empty squares, White's Pawn, empty square on the 4th row.
  - **5R2**: Empty squares, White's Rook on the 3rd row.
  - **1P6**: White's Pawn and empty squares on the 2nd row.
  - **1K6**: White's King and empty squares on the 1st row.
- **w**: It's White's turn to move.
- **-**: The "- "indicates that there is no en passant capture possible.
- **-**: The second "-" indicates that there are no half-moves since the last pawn move or capture (for the 50-move rule).
- **0**: The number of moves since the last pawn move or capture (for the 50-move rule).
- **1**: The current move number.

Let's analyze the position:
- White's King is on b1.
- White's Queen is on d4.
- White's Rooks are on f3 and f6.
- White's Pawns are on b2, b5, g4, and h6.

To find a legal move, we need to check the possible moves for each White piece.

1. **White's King (b1)**: The King can move to a1, a2, or c1, or potentially capture on c2 if it were not for other pieces. However, b2 is occupied by a Pawn, so it can't move there. The move Ka1 or Ka2 is possible.

2. **White's Queen (d4)**: The Queen can move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) from d4. It has several potential moves, including along the d-file, the 4th rank, and the diagonals. For example, Qd1+, Qd2, Qd3, Qa4, Qb4, Qc4, Qe4, Qf4, etc., are possible, depending on the presence of other pieces.

3. **White's Rooks**:
   - The Rook on **f3** can potentially move along the f-file or along the 3rd rank. So, Rf1, Rf2, Re3, Rd3, etc., are possible moves.
   - The Rook on **f6** is somewhat restricted due to being on the same file as another Rook and being near the edge of the board, but it can still move along the 6th rank or potentially capture on f6 if there were a piece there. However, it can move to e6 or d6 or capture on g6 or h6.

Let's directly check for a simple and obvious move:
- **Qd8+** is a potential check, as the Queen can move to d8, putting the Black King in check.

Let's verify if **Qd8+** is a valid move:
- The White Queen is on d4.
- The path to d8 is clear (d4 -> d5 -> d6 -> d7 -> d8), and d8 is not occupied by a White piece.

Thus, **Qd8+** is a valid and strong move as it puts the Black King in check.

To make the move in PGN format, we simply need to write it as is because it's White's first move.
