To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **8/5B2/8/k7/p3p1b1/P4q2/KP3R1Q/2r5 b - - 0 1**

1. **Understanding the FEN**: The FEN notation gives us the current state of the board. Let's break it down:
   - The board: 
     - Black's pieces: king on a5, queen on f3, bishop on b1 (though it seems like it should be g4 or another square given the FEN, we'll work with b1), pawn on a4 and e4.
     - White's pieces: king on a2, queen on h2, rook on f2, bishop on b7, pawn on b2 and a3.
   - It's black's turn.
   - There are no castling rights.
   - There is no en passant square.
   - The move count since the last pawn move or capture is 0.
   - The current move number is 1.

2. **Analyzing the Position**:
   - Black's king is on a5.
   - Black has a queen on f3, which is potentially putting White in a difficult position if it can move or attack effectively.
   - The black bishop is on b1, which seems unusual given the FEN; typically, it would be more actively placed, but let's consider the given position.
   - Black pawns are on a4 and e4.
   - White's king is on a2, somewhat exposed but supported by other pieces.
   - White has a queen on h2, a rook on f2, a bishop on b7, and pawns on b2 and a3.

3. **Finding Legal Moves**:
   - The task is to find a legal move for Black.
   - Let's examine the pieces:
     - The black king (a5) can potentially move to a4 or b5 or b4 (if not checked or putting itself in check).
     - The black queen (f3) can potentially move along the ranks, files, or diagonals it's on.
     - The black bishop (b1) is somewhat restricted; it can potentially move along the diagonal it's on.
     - The black pawns: a4 could potentially capture or move forward if not blocked, and e4 can potentially move forward or capture.

4. **Checking Specific Moves**:
   - The black king can move. For example, Ka5-b4 or Ka5-a6 are potential moves, but we need to check if they are legal.
   - The queen on f3 has several potential moves, such as Qf3-e2 or Qf3-f2, capturing the rook.
   - The bishop on b1 can potentially move to other squares on the diagonal, like a2, but it's somewhat restricted.

5. **Identifying a Legal Move**:
   - One of the simplest moves to check is the capture of the White rook on f2 by the Black queen on f3. The move is Qxf2.

6. **Checking for Check or Checkmate**:
   - After Qxf2, we need to ensure it's a valid move and check if it puts the White king in check.

Let's directly analyze the move:
- Qxf2 is a valid move as it captures the White rook.
- After Qxf2, White's king is on a2, and the Black queen is on f2. The White king is not in check directly because the queen is somewhat blocked or not directly attacking, but we need to verify the check status.

Let's directly check the move: 
1... Qxf2+ is a valid move as it captures the rook and puts the White king in check.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qxf2+
