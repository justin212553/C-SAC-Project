To analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **5r2/2R2P1k/7p/4q3/7K/8/6Q1/8 w - - 0 1**, let's first understand what the FEN notation tells us about the position:

- The board is set up with Black's king on h7, and White's king on h4.
- The material on the board includes a White rook on c7, a White pawn on f7, a Black rook on f8, a Black queen on e5, a Black pawn on h6, and a White queen on g2.

Given it's White's turn, we need to analyze the possible moves for White.

1. **White's King (h4):** The king can potentially move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as it's not into check or onto a square occupied by another White piece. The king can move to g3, g4, g5, or h3, but we need to check if these moves are valid.

2. **White's Rook (c7):** The rook can move horizontally or vertically. It can potentially move along the 7th rank or the c-file. However, its movement along the 7th rank is restricted due to the presence of the Black king on h7 and the White pawn on f7. It can potentially move to c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c8, d7, e7, or b7 if not for the pawn on f7 and the king on h7.

3. **White's Pawn (f7):** The pawn is on f7 and can potentially capture or move forward if not blocked. However, it's on the 7th rank, and its move is restricted. It can capture the Black king on h7 if it's a legal move (capturing the king is a special case as it results in checkmate).

4. **White's Queen (g2):** The queen is highly mobile and can move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) any number of squares. It can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check for valid targets.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:

- The White king has limited mobility due to its current position and the presence of the Black queen, which could potentially put it in check. For example, moving to g5 or h3 could be considered, but we need to check if these moves are safe.

- The White rook on c7 is somewhat restricted. It can move along the c-file or potentially capture on the 7th rank if the Black king weren't there. A potential move could be Rc8, moving the rook to the 8th rank.

- The White pawn on f7 is a key piece. It can capture the Black king on h7. Since the Black king is on h7, and the pawn is on f7, the move **f7xg8=Q#** or simply **fxg8=Q#** if we were promoting (but the pawn is capturing the king, not promoting to a queen in the usual sense), is not applicable because you're capturing a king, not promoting. The correct notation for capturing the king is simply checkmating. So, the pawn can capture the king, resulting in checkmate.

- The White queen on g2 has various potential moves but needs to be checked for validity.

Let's directly check for a valid and potentially checkmating or significant move:

1. The White pawn capturing the Black king is a straightforward checkmate. The move is **1. f7xg8=Q#** or more accurately in PGN for a king capture, we directly check if it's checkmate.

The position is already quite advanced, and upon closer inspection, **1. Rxk7#** isn't possible because the rook can't capture the king directly due to the pawn on f7 being in the way, and the king not being on c7. However, **1. f8=Q#** isn't possible directly either because there's no move to f8 for the pawn.

The actual checkmate can be achieved with **1. Qg7#**, as the queen can move to g7, putting the Black king in checkmate.

Let's verify the move: 
- The White queen on g2 can move to g7, putting the Black king in checkmate.

Thus, the thought process leads to identifying a checkmating move.
