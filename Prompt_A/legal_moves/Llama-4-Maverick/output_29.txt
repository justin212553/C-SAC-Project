To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given FEN position: **r1b1Rbk1/1p3p1p/p2q2pQ/3P4/3Nn3/1P1n1PP1/PB4BP/R5K1 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- **r1b1Rbk1**: The eighth rank (black's starting rank) has a rook, a bishop, a white rook (indicating a capture or unusual starting position), a bishop, a king, and a knight.
- **1p3p1p**: The seventh rank has a pawn, three empty squares, a pawn, an empty square, and a pawn.
- **p2q2pQ**: The sixth rank has a pawn, two empty squares, a black queen, two empty squares, a pawn, and a white queen.
- **3P4**: The fifth rank has three empty squares, a white pawn, and four empty squares.
- **3Nn3**: The fourth rank has three empty squares, a white knight, a black knight, and three empty squares.
- **1P1n1PP1**: The third rank has an empty square, a white pawn, an empty square, a black knight, an empty square, two white pawns, an empty square.
- **PB4BP**: The second rank has a white pawn, a white bishop, four empty squares, a black pawn, and a white pawn.
- **R5K1**: The first rank has a white rook, five empty squares, a white king, and an empty square.

Given it's white's turn, let's analyze the pieces:

1. **White Rook on e8**: Can potentially move along the e-file or along the eighth rank, but its movement is restricted due to other pieces and the edge of the board.
2. **White Queen on h6**: Can move to various squares along the h-file, the sixth rank, or diagonally.
3. **White Knight on d4**: Can potentially move to b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f3, or f5.
4. **White Pawn on d5**: Can potentially capture.
5. **White Pawn on b3**: Can't move forward due to the black knight on d3, but it's not blocked from capturing if an opportunity arises.
6. **White Pawn on g3**: Can potentially move forward.
7. **White Bishop on c2**: Can potentially move along the diagonals it's on.
8. **White Pawn on g2**: Can potentially move forward.
9. **White King on g1**: Can potentially move to f1, f2, h1, or h2, but it's somewhat restricted due to the need to potentially castle or avoid putting itself in check.
10. **White Rook on a1**: Can potentially move along the a-file or the first rank.

Let's examine potential moves:

- The White Queen on h6 can move. One possible move is Qg7# because it puts the black king in checkmate.
- Other pieces have limited mobility or are blocked.

Let's directly check the move **Qg7#**:

1. Is it a valid move for the White Queen? Yes, it is.
2. Does it put the black king in checkmate? Yes, it does.

Therefore, the move is **1. Qg7#**.

1. Qg7#
