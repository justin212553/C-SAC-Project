To solve this task, let's first analyze the given FEN position: **8/1Q4R1/p3q2p/5ppk/8/4P1PP/2r5/6K1 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- The board is represented row by row from the 8th row to the 1st row.
- "8" means an empty row.
- "1Q4R1" means an empty square, a White Queen, four empty squares, a White Rook, and an empty square on the 8th row (from White's perspective, or the 1st row from Black's perspective).
- "p3q2p" represents a Black pawn, three empty squares, a Black Queen, two empty squares, and a Black pawn on the 6th row.
- "5ppk" represents five empty squares, two Black pawns, and a Black King on the 5th row.
- "8" represents an empty row.
- "4P1PP" represents four empty squares, a White pawn, an empty square, a White pawn, and a White pawn on the 3rd row.
- "2r5" represents two empty squares, a Black Rook, and five empty squares on the 2nd row.
- "6K1" represents six empty squares, a White King, and an empty square on the 1st row.
- "w" indicates it's White's turn.
- "- -" indicates there's no en passant square and no castling rights.
- "0 1" indicates there have been 0 moves since the last pawn move or capture, and it's the 1st move.

Let's analyze the position:
- White pieces: Queen on b7, Rook on g7, King on g1, pawns on e3, g3, and h3.
- Black pieces: Queen on e6, Rook on c2, King on h5, pawns on a6, f5, g5, and h6.

Now, let's consider the possible moves for White:
1. The White Queen (b7) can potentially move to various squares but is somewhat restricted. It can move along the b-file or the 7th rank.
2. The White Rook (g7) is somewhat restricted due to the presence of the White Queen on the 7th rank but can potentially move along the g-file or the 7th rank if not blocked or capturing.
3. The White King (g1) can potentially move to f1 or h1, or f2.
4. The White pawns are somewhat restricted. The pawn on e3 can potentially move to e4. The pawns on g3 and h3 can potentially move forward.

Let's directly examine potential moves:
- Qb7 can move to various squares (e.g., a6, a8, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, c6, c7, c8, d5, d7, e4, e7, f7). Checking for valid moves: Qxa6 is a valid capture.
- Rg7 can move along the g-file or the 7th rank. It can potentially capture on g5 or f7, or move to g8. Checking for valid moves: Rxg5 is a valid move but would be a capture. Rg8 is also a valid move.
- The White King has limited mobility due to its current position but can move to f1 or h1.
- The White pawns can potentially move forward.

Let's directly check for a simple valid move:
- One simple valid move is for the White King to move to f1 (Kg1-f1 or Kf1).

Let's verify if Kf1 is a valid move and if there are any other simple valid moves.

Upon closer inspection:
- The White Rook on g7 can move to g8 (Rg8+), putting the Black King in check.

Let's directly output a valid PGN move.
