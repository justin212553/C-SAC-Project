To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given FEN position: **4B1NK/7R/R4r2/8/3b4/2kq4/8/7R b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- The position is from Black's perspective, as indicated by "b" (the second character from the end).
- The board is represented row by row from the 8th to the 1st rank.
  - **4B1NK**: 8th rank - 4 empty squares, White Bishop, empty, White King, White Knight.
  - **7R**: 7th rank - 7 empty squares, White Rook.
  - **R4r2**: 6th rank - White Rook, 4 empty squares, Black Rook, 2 empty squares.
  - **8**: 5th rank - All empty.
  - **3b4**: 4th rank - 3 empty squares, Black Bishop, 4 empty.
  - **2kq4**: 3rd rank - 2 empty, Black King, Black Queen, 4 empty.
  - **8**: 2nd rank - All empty.
  - **7R**: 1st rank - 7 empty, White Rook.

Let's analyze the position:
- Black King is on c3.
- Black has a Queen on d3, a Bishop on d4, and a Rook on f6.

First, we check if the Black King is in check. The White King is on g8, the White Bishop on e8, the White Knight on h8, and there are White Rooks on a6, h7, and h1. The Black King is not directly in check by any of these pieces.

Let's examine possible moves for Black:
1. **Black King (c3)**: Can move to b2, b3 (if the Queen or other pieces weren't there), c2, d2, d3 (occupied by the Queen), or potentially other squares if not for the presence of other Black pieces or the edges of the board. The King can potentially move to b2, c2, or d2.
   
2. **Black Queen (d3)**: Can potentially move in various directions, but it's on d3, so let's check: It can move along the d-file or the 3rd rank. However, it's somewhat restricted by the King and the Bishop.

3. **Black Bishop (d4)**: Can potentially move along the diagonals it's on. It can move to c3 (occupied by the King, so not possible), c5, e3 (occupied by the King or other pieces), e5, or other squares along its diagonals.

4. **Black Rook (f6)**: Can move along the f-file or the 6th rank. It can potentially capture the White Rook on a6.

Let's directly check for a valid move:
- The Black King can move from c3 to c2: **...Kc2**.
- The Black Queen can potentially move. Checking its moves: It can move to various squares, but we need to check for a valid move. For example, **...Qd2#** is not possible because there's no White King in check on d2, and it's not checkmate. However, we can check if it can move to a safe square or put the White King in check.

Let's directly analyze a potential move:
- The Black Rook on f6 can capture the White Rook on a6: **...Rxa6**.

Let's verify if **...Rxa6** is a valid move and if it's check or checkmate.

Upon closer inspection:
- **1... Rxa6** is a valid move.

Let's check for check or checkmate:
- After **1... Rxa6**, the position doesn't immediately suggest checkmate because the White King is somewhat safe on g8.

Let's directly provide the PGN for the valid move.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rxa6
[FINAL PGN] is not needed as per the format; the correct format is directly providing the PGN.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rxa6
