To analyze the given chess position defined by the FEN: **8/p1K5/k1P5/8/1p6/3P1P2/5R2/4R3 w - - 0 1**, let's first understand the position.

The FEN notation breaks down as follows:
- The board: 
  - Row 8: Empty
  - Row 7: Black pawn on a7, empty squares until the end
  - Row 6: White King on c7, empty squares until the end
  - Row 5: Black king on a6, White pawn on c6, rest empty
  - Row 4: Black pawn on b4, rest empty
  - Row 3: White pawns on d3 and f3, rest empty
  - Row 2: White Rook on f2, rest empty
  - Row 1: White Rook on e1, rest empty
- It's White's turn to move.
- There are no en passant captures available.
- There are no castling rights.
- The move number is 1.

Let's analyze the position:
1. **White King (c7):** The King can potentially move to c8, b7, b6 (if it weren't for the pawn on c6), or d7 (but d7 is not a valid move due to being into check from the a7 pawn and potentially being next to the black king). The most viable move seems to be c8 or b7. However, we need to check for other pieces.
   
2. **White Pawns:**
   - **c6:** Can't capture, can potentially move forward if not for being blocked by the black king or other pieces. It is also not possible to move forward because c7 is occupied by the White King.
   - **d3 and f3:** These pawns are blocked by other pieces or can't move forward.

3. **White Rooks:**
   - **f2:** Can potentially move along the f-file or along the second rank. It can move to f1, f3 (capture), f4, f5, f6, f7 (check), f8.
   - **e1:** Can move along the e-file or the first rank. It can potentially move to e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7 (check), e8 or d1, c1, b1, a1.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:
- The White King can move to b7 or c8. Kc8 is a valid move, putting the King in a safer position. Kb7 is also valid but let's check other options.
- The Rooks have several potential moves. Notably, Rf7+ is a check and a strong move.

Let's directly check the most promising moves:
1. **Kc8:** A safe move for the King.
2. **Rf7+:** A check, which is a significant move.

Let's directly evaluate these in PGN format.

The most straightforward valid move is **Rf7+**, which is a check.
