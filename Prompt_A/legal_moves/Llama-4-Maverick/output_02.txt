To solve this problem, let's first understand the given position using the FEN notation: **5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1**.

Breaking down the FEN:
- The position is: Black King on f8, White King on h8; Black Queen on g7, Black Knight on f7; Black Bishop on g6.
- It's Black's turn to move (indicated by 'b').
- There are no castling rights available (indicated by '-').
- There is no en passant square (indicated by '-').
- The half-move clock is 0, and the full move number is 1.

Now, let's analyze the position:
1. **Black King (f8)**: The Black King can move to e8 or e7 or f7 (though f7 is occupied by the Black Knight, so it's not a valid move). So, Ke8 or Ke7 are possible moves.
2. **Black Queen (g7)**: The Black Queen has several potential moves along the g-file and the 7th rank, but it's currently blocked by the White King on the h-file and doesn't have a clear path along the 7th rank. However, it can potentially move to h7 or h6 or f8 (though f8 is occupied by the Black King, so it's not valid) or g8. Qh7 and Qh6 are possible moves.
3. **Black Knight (f7)**: The Black Knight can potentially move to d8, d6, e5, g5, or h6 (though h6 is guarded by the Black Queen's potential move, but it's not a concern as the Knight can't capture the Queen). So, Nd8, Nd6, Ne5, Ng5 are valid moves.
4. **Black Bishop (g6)**: The Black Bishop can move along the diagonal it's on. Potential moves include f5, h5, h7, e8, d3 (not possible due to being off the board), or f7 (not possible because it's occupied by the Black Knight). So, Bf5, Bh5, Bh7 are possible.

Let's check for any checks or checkmates:
- The White King is on h8, and the Black Queen is on g7. The Black Queen can potentially put the White King in check.

Considering the pieces and their possible moves, one simple valid move is to be made. Let's directly check a straightforward move.

One of the simplest moves to consider is moving the Black Queen. Qh6+ is a valid move as it puts the White King in check.

Let's directly output this move in PGN format.

1... Qh6+
