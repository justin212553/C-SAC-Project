To solve this, let's first understand the given position and then analyze the possible moves.

The given FEN is: **bn2k3/2R2r2/1p1p4/3N2BB/4P3/2P3PP/r4r2/R3n2K w - - 0 1**

Let's break down the position:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The White king is on h1, and the Black king is on e8.
- There's a White knight on d5, White bishops on d5 and g5 (wait, there's a White knight on d5, so one of the "B"s must be a different piece or incorrectly placed; given the context, it seems there's a White bishop on g5 and another piece or a typo involving the "B" on d5, but we have a knight there, so it's likely referring to the presence of a bishop on g5 and the "B" on d5 is actually a part of the notation error or misinterpretation; the actual position has a White knight on d5), White pawns on c3 and e4 and g3, and White rooks on c7 and a1.
- Black has a knight on e1 (actually, it's a White piece; this must be a typo, and it should refer to a Black piece, likely "n" for knight on a different or this square), a bishop or other piece on b8 or nearby (the "b" on b8), Black pawns on b6 and d6, and Black rooks on f7 and a2, and another "r" on f2.

Let's analyze the White pieces that can move:
1. The White knight on d5 can potentially move. Let's check its possible moves: Nd5 can move to b4, b6, c7 (capture), e3, e7 (capture), f4, f6+ (check).
   
2. The White bishop on g5 can move. Bg5 can potentially move to various squares like f4, f6 (capture), h4, h6.

3. The White pawns: e4 can potentially move to e5; c3 is somewhat restricted but could potentially move to c4; g3 could move to g4.

4. The White rooks: Rc7 is somewhat restricted but could potentially move along the 7th rank or back to c1 or c2 or c3 if not for the presence of other pieces; Ra1 can potentially move along the 1st rank or the 'a' file.

Let's directly examine potential moves:
- The White knight on d5 can jump to several places, including f6+ which is a check.
- The White bishop on g5 can move to f6, potentially capturing and giving check or checkmate.

Let's directly check for a simple, legal move:
1. Checking the White knight on d5: It can move to f6+, which is a check.

Let's verify if Bf6+ or Nxf6+ or Nxe7 is possible and legal.

Given the position and focusing on simplicity and legality:
- Nxf6+ or Bxf6 could be considered if it were not for the fact that we need to verify the exact position and potential captures or checks.

Let's directly analyze a potential move:
The move **Nf6+** is a potential candidate if the Black king is exposed and if the move is legal.

Let's directly check the move: 
1. **Nf6+** is a potential move if it is legal.

To directly provide a simple, legal move:
Let's directly check the simplest moves.

One of the simplest moves to check is **Nf6+**.

Let's directly verify the move.

The position allows for **g4**, **Nf6+**, or other moves.

One simple and straightforward move is **g4**.

Let's directly provide the PGN for a simple, legal move.
