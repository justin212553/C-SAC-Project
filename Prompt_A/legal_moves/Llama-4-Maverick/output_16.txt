To solve this problem, let's analyze the given FEN position: **3k4/7p/pp1P1rp1/4K3/7r/1P1N1b2/P7/R3R3 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN string represents. The FEN string is a notation that describes a particular position of a chess board. Here's a breakdown of the given FEN:

- **3k4/7p/pp1P1rp1/4K3/7r/1P1N1b2/P7/R3R3**: This part describes the pieces on the board.
  - The rows are described from the 8th rank to the 1st rank.
  - '3k4' means there's a black king on d8, with 3 empty squares on its left and 4 on its right on the 8th rank.
  - '7p' means there are 7 empty squares followed by a black pawn on h7.
  - 'pp1P1rp1' describes the 6th rank with black pawns on a6 and b6, a white pawn on d6, a black pawn or piece on f6, a black rook on g6, and a black pawn on h6.
  - '4K3' indicates a white king on e5.
  - '7r' means 7 empty squares followed by a black rook on h4.
  - '1P1N1b2' describes the 3rd rank with a white pawn on b3, a white knight on d3, a black bishop on f3, and 2 empty squares on g3 and h3.
  - 'P7' indicates a white pawn on a2 and 7 empty squares on the rest of the 2nd rank.
  - 'R3R3' means a white rook on a1, 3 empty squares, and another white rook on e1.

- 'b': It's black's turn to move.
- '-': The '-' indicates that there's no en passant square.
- '-': There's no information about the number of moves since the last pawn move or capture, implying it's not relevant or it's 0.
- '0': The number of half-moves since the last pawn move or capture is 0.
- '1': The fullmove number is 1, indicating this is the first move of the game.

Now, let's analyze the position to find a legal move for Black:

1. **Black King (d8):** The king can potentially move to c8, c7, d7, e8, or e7. However, we need to check if these moves are legal by ensuring the king isn't moving into check.

2. **Black Pawns and other pieces:** 
   - The pawn on h7 can move to h6 or h5, but h6 is occupied, so it can potentially move to h5.
   - The pawns on a6 and b6 are blocked by the white pawn on d6 indirectly but can potentially move forward if not blocked by other pieces or if capturing diagonally.
   - The rook on g6 can potentially move along the g-file or along the 6th rank.
   - The rook on h4 can potentially move along the h-file or along the 4th rank.
   - The bishop on f3 can potentially move along its diagonals.

Let's directly examine potential moves:
- The black king on d8 can move to c7 or e7 or c8. Let's check if any of these are under attack.
- The white king is on e5, and there's a white knight on d3. The king is somewhat far, but we need to check for potential checks.
- The black rook on g6 is somewhat exposed but not directly under attack.
- The black rook on h4 is also somewhat exposed.

Let's directly check for a simple move:
- **Kg6** is not possible as the king is on d8.
- **Rh5** or **Rh6** could be considered for the rook on h4, but let's check the king's moves first.

Let's directly analyze a potential move for the black king:
- Moving the king to c8, c7, or e7. The white king is on e5, so moving to e7 might be under its influence, but let's check.

The black king can move to **c8** or **c7**. Let's verify:
- **1... Kd8-c7** is a valid move.

Let's check if there are any other simple moves:
- The rook on h4 can move. For example, **1... Rh4-h5** or **1... Rh4-h3** are potential moves.

Let's directly check the PGN for a valid move.

To provide a valid PGN, we need to identify a legal move. One simple move is **1... Rh4-h5**.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rh4-h5
