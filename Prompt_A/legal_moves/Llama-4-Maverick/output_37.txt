To solve this, let's analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **r1bk3r/pppq1ppp/5n2/4N1N1/2Bp4/Bn6/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The FEN indicates the positions of the pieces. Let's decode it:
  - **r1bk3r**: Black's Rook on a8, Knight not on b8 (implying a Pawn or other piece is not there, but actually, it means there's a Rook on a8 and a Pawn or other configuration on b8 is not relevant here directly), Bishop on c8, King on d8 (or possibly e8 if castling has occurred, but the King is more likely on e8 or d8, here it's d8), 3 empty squares (implying the presence of other Black pieces or empty squares), and a Rook on h8.
  - **pppq1ppp**: Black Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7 (not on d6), e7 (or possibly on e6 or e5, but here it's e7), f7, g7, h7.
  - **5n2**: An empty square (or squares) followed by a Black Knight on f6.
  - **4N1N1**: An empty square (or squares) followed by a White Knight on e5, an empty square, a White Knight on g5.
  - **2Bp4**: Two empty squares or pieces not relevant, a White Bishop on c4, followed by 4 empty squares.
  - **Bn6**: A White Bishop on b3, a Black Knight on b4 (implied by 'n'), followed by 6 empty squares.
  - **P4PPP**: White Pawns on a2, followed by 4 empty squares or pieces, White Pawns on f2, g2, h2 (though the exact configuration isn't directly stated, we infer Pawns are on f2, g2, and possibly h2 or other configurations).
  - **4R1K1**: An empty square (or squares), a White Rook on e1, an empty square, a White King on g1.

Let's directly analyze the position:
1. White King is on g1.
2. White Rook is on e1.
3. White Bishop is on c4 and b3.
4. White Knights are on e5 and g5.
5. White Pawns are on a2, f2, g2, and possibly h2.

Let's look at the pieces that can move:
- The White King on g1 can potentially move, but it's somewhat restricted due to the need to potentially castle or avoid putting itself in check. However, it's not in check and has the potential move to h1 or f1 if the squares are considered safe.
- The White Rook on e1 can move along the e-file.
- The White Bishops on c4 and b3 can potentially move. The Bishop on c4 can move along the diagonal, and the one on b3 can potentially capture the Knight on b4 or move along its diagonal.
- The White Knights on e5 and g5 have potential moves. The Knight on e5 can potentially jump to c6, d7, f7, g4, g6, d3, or c4 (though c4 is occupied). The Knight on g5 can potentially jump to e4, e6, f7, or h7 (capturing the Pawn), or h3.
- The White Pawns have limited mobility. The Pawn on a2 can potentially move to a3 or a4. The Pawn on f2 can move to f3 or f4.

Let's directly examine potential moves:
- The White Rook on e1 can move to e2, e3, etc., or potentially capture on e8 if it were open.
- The Bishop on b3 can capture the Knight on b4 (if it's there, as 'n' on b4 is indicated), so Bxb4 is a potential move.
- The Knight on g5 can capture the Pawn on h7, so Nxh7 is a potential move.

Let's directly check a simple and obvious move:
- **Bxb4+** is a potential move as it puts the Black King in check and is a valid move given the Bishop on b3 and the Knight on b4.

Let's directly analyze and provide the PGN:
The move **Bxb4+** is a valid move. 

[FINAL PGN]
1. Bxb4+
