To solve this problem, let's first understand the given position using the FEN notation: **4r1k1/p4ppp/bN6/2bP4/4n1n1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1BK3R b - - 0 1**

Breaking down the FEN:
- **4r1k1**: The eighth rank (black's starting rank) has a rook on the fifth file and a king on the eighth file, with a square between them being empty.
- **p4ppp**: The seventh rank has a pawn on the second file and pawns on the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth files.
- **bN6**: The sixth rank has a bishop on the first file and a knight on the second file.
- **2bP4**: The fifth rank has a bishop on the third file and a pawn on the fourth file.
- **4n1n1**: The fourth rank has a knight on the fifth file and a knight on the seventh file.
- **5N2**: The third rank has a knight on the sixth file.
- **PPPQ1PPP**: The second rank has pawns on the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, and eighth files, with a queen on the fifth file.
- **R1BK3R**: The first rank (white's starting rank) has a rook on the first file, a king on the fourth file, a bishop on the fifth file, and a rook on the eighth file.

The position is black to move.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for black:
1. **Rook on e8**: Can move along the eighth rank or the e-file. It can capture on e1 (though it's guarded by the white king) or potentially move to e7 or other squares along the e-file if not blocked, but it's blocked by the white king on e1 indirectly as the rook can't capture the king. It can potentially move to d8 or c8 or b8 or a8 along the rank.
   
2. **Pawns**: The pawns on f7, g7, and h7 can potentially move forward one or two squares. The pawn on a7 can move forward one or two squares as well.

3. **Bishop on c5**: Can move along the diagonals it's on. It can potentially move to b6, a7 (capturing the pawn), d4, e3 (capturing the knight), or f2.

4. **Knights**: The knight on e4 can potentially move to c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, or g5. The knight on g4 can move to e3 (capturing the knight), e5, f2, f6, h2, or h6.

Let's check for valid moves:
- The rook on e8 can move to other squares on the e-file or the eighth rank. So, Re7 is a valid move.
- The bishop on c5 can move. Be3 is a valid capture.
- The knights have several potential moves. Nxf2 and Nxe3 are valid moves for the knights.

Let's directly examine a simple and clear move:
- The knight on g4 can capture the knight on f3 (Nxf2 is not possible because f2 is occupied by a pawn implicitly, but Nxf3 is not an option as the knight is on f3). However, Nxe3 is a valid move.

Let's consider **Nxe3** as a potential move. It's a capture, so it's a valid move.

The FEN indicates it's black's turn, and the move number is 1.

So, the PGN move for **Nxe3** would be **1... Nxe3**.

1... Nxe3
