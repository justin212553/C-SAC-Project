To solve this, let's analyze the given FEN position: **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what the FEN notation tells us. The given FEN is broken down as follows:
- The board setup: **8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2**
  - The rows are described from the 8th to the 1st rank.
  - The first row (8th rank) to the fourth row (5th rank) are empty.
  - The fifth row (4th rank) has a black king on the fifth file (e4), a black pawn on the sixth file (f4), and a black knight on the seventh file (g4), and the rest are empty.
  - The sixth row (3rd rank) has a black king on the fifth file (e3), and the rest are empty except for a black pawn on the sixth file (f2).
  - The seventh row (2nd rank) has a white king on the sixth file (f1), and the rest are empty except for a black pawn on the seventh file (g2) is not on the board, it's actually on f2.
  - The eighth row (1st rank) has a white king on the sixth file (f1), and the rest are empty.

Correcting the understanding:
- Black king is on e3.
- Black pawn is on f2.
- White king is on f1.

Since it's black's turn, we analyze the possible moves for black pieces.

1. The black king on e3 can potentially move. Let's examine its possible moves:
   - The king can move to d2, d3, d4, e2, e4, f3, f4. However, we need to check if these moves are valid (not into check, and not onto occupied squares).
   - e2 is occupied by a black pawn (f2), so it's not a valid move to e2 if we consider the presence of the pawn on f2. 
   - e4 is occupied by a black pawn (on f4, but that's on a different file, so it's valid).
   - The white king is on f1, so moving to e2 is not possible due to the presence of the black pawn on f2, making e2 not a valid destination due to being adjacent to f1 where the white king is, but primarily because f2 is occupied.

2. Let's directly check the valid moves:
   - The black king can move to d2, d3, d4, e2 (not valid due to being next to the white king and having a pawn on f2), e4, f3, f4.
   - The move to e2 is actually not valid because it's next to the white king on f1.

3. Checking the pawns:
   - The pawn on f2 can potentially move to f1, promoting to any piece.

Let's directly analyze valid moves:
- The black king can move to several places, but we need to check for check or other invalidations.
- The black pawn on f2 can move to f1, promoting.

One valid move is **1... f1=Q+**. Let's verify:
- The black pawn on f2 can promote to a queen on f1, putting the white king on f1 in check.

Thus, a valid PGN move is: 

[FINAL PGN]
1... f1=Q+
