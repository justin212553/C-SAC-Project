To solve this, let's analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with White having a King on a1, a Bishop on c4, a pawn on b4 and c5, and a Rook on h7.
- Black has a King on a6.

The task is to find a legal move for White.

Let's analyze the pieces:
1. **White King (a1):** The King is somewhat safe but limited in movement due to its position on the edge. It can potentially move to a2 or b1 or b2 if not for the fact that b2 is not a valid move due to being next to another King without being in check and b1 is occupied by the potential influence of the Black King, but actually, it's just a matter of checking the immediate squares. The King can move to a2.

2. **White Rook (h7):** The Rook is on h7, potentially pinning or putting pressure on the Black King. It can move along the 7th rank or up and down the h-file. However, its movement is somewhat restricted. It can move to h6, h5, h4, h3, h2, or h1, or along the 7th rank to g7 or f7, or even e7, d7, c7, or b7, as long as it doesn't put the White King in check or capture a piece that it's not allowed to capture. The Rook can potentially move to any of these squares.

3. **White Bishop (c4):** The Bishop is on c4 and can potentially move along the diagonal it's on. It can move to d3, e2, or f1, or along the other diagonal to b3, a2 (though a2 is occupied by a potential King move), or to d5, e6, f7 (if the Rook moves), or b5.

4. **White Pawns (b4, c5):** The pawns are on b4 and c5. The pawn on b4 can potentially move forward to b5. The pawn on c5 can move to c6.

Let's consider the moves:
- The White King can move from a1 to a2.
- The White Rook on h7 has several potential moves, including h6, which is a check.
- The White Bishop can move, for example, to d3 or b5 (putting the Black King in check), or to b3.
- The White Pawns can potentially advance.

One of the simplest and most straightforward moves to consider is the Rook moving to h6+, putting the Black King in check.

Let's verify if **1. Rh6+** is a valid move:
- The Rook is on h7.
- Moving to h6 is a valid move and it puts the Black King in check.

Thus, a valid move is **1. Rh6+**.
