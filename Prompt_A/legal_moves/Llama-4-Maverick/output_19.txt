To solve this task, let's first analyze the given position defined by the FEN: **1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The FEN notation gives us the position of the pieces on the board. Let's decode it:
  - **1K1R4**: White King on b8, Rook on d8, empty squares on a8, c8, e8, f8, g8, h8.
  - **1PP2PPP**: White Pawns on b7, c7, f7, g7, h7, empty on d7, e7.
  - **8**: Eighth rank is empty.
  - **P4p2**: White Pawn on a5, Black Pawn on f5, empty on b5, c5, d5, e5, Pawns on g5, h5.
  - **pN1Q2p1**: Black Pawn on a4, White Knight on b4, White Queen on d4, Black Pawn on g4, empty on h4.
  - **1pNp1q1p**: Empty on a3, Black Pawn on b3, White Knight on c3, Black Queen on f3, Black Pawn on h3.
  - **1kp1r3**: White King on b2, Black Pawn on c2, empty on d2, Black Rook on e2, empty on f2, g2, h2.
  - **2r5**: Black Rook on c1, empty on d1, e1, f1, g1, h1.

Now, let's analyze the moveable White pieces:
1. **White King (b8)**: Can move to a7 or c7 (since it's not on the first rank and has adjacent squares).
2. **White Rook (d8)**: Can move along the d-file or along the eighth rank. It can capture on d4.
3. **White Pawns**: 
   - b7 can move to b8 (potentially with promotion).
   - c7 can move to c8 (potentially with promotion).
   - f7, g7, h7 can move forward one or two squares.
4. **White Knights**:
   - b4 can move to a2, a6, c2, c6, d3, d5.
   - c3 can move to a2, a4, b1, b5, d1, d5, e2, e4.

Let's check for any immediate possible moves:
- The White King can move to a7 or c7.
- The White Rook can capture the Queen on d4.
- White Pawns have potential moves, but we need to check for legality.
- White Knights have several potential moves.

Let's directly check for a simple and legal move:
- **Rxd4** is a straightforward capture.

To verify if **Rxd4** is legal:
- The Rook on d8 can capture the Queen on d4.
- This move is legal as it follows standard chess rules.

Let's format this move in PGN:
1. Rxd4
