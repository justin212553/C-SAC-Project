To solve this problem, let's analyze the given FEN position: **8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what this FEN position represents. The FEN notation is a standardized way to describe a particular position of a chess board. Let's break down the given FEN:

- **8/8/8/1k6/4r3/8/5PPP/6K1**: This part describes the position of the pieces on the board.
  - The rows are described from the 8th row (black's back row) to the 1st row (white's back row).
  - '8' means an empty row.
  - '1k6' means one black king on the 'b' file (second file from the left), followed by six empty squares.
  - '4r3' means four empty squares, followed by a black rook, followed by three empty squares.
  - '5PPP' means five empty squares, followed by three white pawns.
  - '6K1' means six empty squares, followed by a white king, followed by one empty square.
- **b**: Indicates it's black's turn to move.
- **-**: No en passant square.
- **-**: No halfmove clock.
- **0**: Fullmove number (1 in this case, but it's the first move for black, so it's counted as black's first move).

Let's visualize the board:
- Black King is on b5.
- Black Rook is on e4.
- White King is on g1.
- White Pawns are on f2, g2, and h2.

Now, let's analyze the possible moves for black:
1. **Black King on b5**: The king can move to b4, b6, a5, a4 (if it weren't for the potential presence of other pieces, but here it's just about being on the board and not being in check), a6, c5, c4, or c6. The king is not in check, and moving to any adjacent square doesn't put it in check directly because there are no white pieces that would attack it directly after a single move. So, possible king moves are considered.
   
2. **Black Rook on e4**: The rook can move along the 'e' file or on the 4th rank. So, it can move to e1, e2, e3, e5, e6, e7, e8, d4, c4, b4, or a4.

Let's check for any immediate checks or captures:
- The white king is on g1, and the black rook can potentially put it in check if it moves to e1. So, Re1+ is a valid move.

Given the instructions, we need to provide a valid PGN move. Let's consider a simple and valid move for black.

The black rook can move to e1, putting the white king in check.

1... Re1+ is a valid move.

Let's format it according to the PGN notation.

1... Re1+
