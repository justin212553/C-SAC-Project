To solve this problem, let's first understand the given position defined by the FEN: **r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to decode the FEN to understand the position:
- **r3N2k**: The black rook is on a8, there's a knight on e8, and the black king is on h8.
- **R4R2**: A white rook is on a7, and another white rook is on f7.
- **2p3pp/4p3**: Black pawns are on c6, f6, g6, and e5.
- **3n2bb**: A black knight is on d4, and black bishops are on g4 and h4.
- **1P1P4**: White pawns are on b3 and d3.
- **2r2R2**: A black rook is on c2, and a white rook is on f2.
- **BN2K3**: A white bishop is on b1, a white knight is on e1 (though this is a bit unusual as the starting position for a knight is typically on g1 or b1, and e1 is reserved for the king), and the white king is on e1.

Given it's black's turn (indicated by 'b' in the FEN), we need to analyze the possible moves for black.

1. **Black King (h8)**: The king can potentially move to g7 or h7, but we need to check if these moves are legal. The king is not in check, so we just need to ensure the destination squares are not under attack.

2. **Black Pieces**:
   - **Rook (a8)**: Can potentially move along the a-file or to other squares on the 8th rank. However, it's currently blocked by the white rook on a7 and the black knight on e8, so its movement is restricted.
   - **Knight (d4)**: Can potentially move to various squares (b3, b5, c6, e2, e6, f3, f5). We need to check which of these moves are valid.
   - **Knight (e8)**: Can potentially move to c7, d6, f6, or g7. Again, we need to check the validity of these moves.
   - **Bishops (g4 and h4)**: The bishop on g4 can potentially move along the g4-d1 diagonal or the g4-h3 diagonal (though h3 is occupied by a black pawn). The bishop on h4 can potentially move along the h4-e1 diagonal or the h4-f2 diagonal, but it's worth noting that the white rook on f2 is on this diagonal.
   - **Rook (c2)**: Can potentially move along the c-file or the 2nd rank.

Let's directly examine potential moves:
- The black rook on a8 is blocked by the white rook on a7. It can't capture the white rook because it's protected by being on the same rank as the white king and potentially pinned, but more directly, it's because the white rook is not on a square the black rook can directly capture due to being on a7 and not a8-adjacent. However, it can potentially move to other squares on the 8th rank if not blocked or to other files on the a-file if not blocked.
- The black knight on d4 has potential moves like b3 (capturing a pawn), c6 (capturing a pawn), e2, e6, f3, f5.
- The black knight on e8 can move to c7, d6, f6, or g7.
- The black bishops can potentially move. The one on g4 can move to other squares on the diagonal (like f3, e2, d1, h3, h5). The one on h4 can potentially capture the white rook on f2.

Let's directly check for a valid move:
- One of the simplest moves to check is the **Bishop on h4 capturing the Rook on f2**. This is a potential move as BxR is a valid capture.

Let's analyze the move **1... Bh4xf2**:
- It's black's turn, so the move number should be 1... (indicating it's black's first move).
- The bishop on h4 captures the rook on f2.

So, the PGN for this move is **1... Bxf2**.
