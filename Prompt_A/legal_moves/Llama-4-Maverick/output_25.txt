To solve this, let's analyze the given FEN position: **2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1**

First, we break down the position:
- The board is represented in FEN notation, with 'w' indicating it's White's turn.
- The position is: 
  - White: King on a4, Queen on f6, Bishop on f5, Rook on c8, Pawn on a5.
  - Black: King on a8, Queen on h7, Rook on f7, Pawn on b7, Pawn on a6, Bishop on f2.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for White:
1. **King (a4):** The King can potentially move to a3, a5, or b4, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
   - a3: Not possible due to being off the board.
   - a5: The Pawn on a5 is in the way, so this move is not possible.
   - b4: This is a potential move as there's no piece directly blocking it, but we need to check for checks or captures.
   - b3, b5: These are not directly considered due to the initial assessment focusing on adjacent squares.

2. **Queen (f6):** The Queen can move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) from f6.
   - It can capture the Black Rook on f7, which is a potential move: Qxf7.

3. **Bishop (f5):** The Bishop can move diagonally.
   - It can potentially move to various squares, but we need to check for valid targets or safe moves.

4. **Rook (c8):** The Rook can move horizontally or vertically.
   - It can potentially capture the Black Rook on f8 (if it were there), but since f8 is empty, we look elsewhere. It can potentially move to c7 or c6 if not for the fact that c7 is occupied by a Black Pawn and c6 is not a valid target due to being occupied by a Black Pawn indirectly (a6 is occupied).

5. **Pawn (a5):** The Pawn can potentially move forward or capture diagonally.
   - Moving forward to a6 is not possible because it's occupied by a Black Pawn.
   - Capturing diagonally is not an option here.

Let's directly assess the most promising or obvious moves:
- **Qxf7** is a straightforward and strong move as it captures a Black Rook.
- The King moving to a safer position or checking the Black King could be considered, but the immediate check or capture is more pressing.

Let's directly check the validity of **Qxf7**:
- **1.Qxf7** is a valid move as it captures the Rook on f7.

Other potential moves like **1.Kb4** or **1.Rc7** could be considered, but **Qxf7** is a clear capture.

Let's directly evaluate the move **1.Qxf7**:
- After **1.Qxf7 Qxf7**, White can play **2.Rc7**, but we are only concerned with the first move.

The thought process directly leads to a simple and strong move.
