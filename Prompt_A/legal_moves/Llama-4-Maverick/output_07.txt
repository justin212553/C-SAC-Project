To solve this, let's analyze the given FEN position: **5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with White to move.
- The FEN notation breaks down as follows:
  - **5rkr**: Black's back rank has a Rook, King, and Rook from left to right on the 8th rank.
  - **5ppp**: Black's pawns are on the 7th rank, on the f, g, and h files.
  - **8**: The 6th and 5th ranks are empty.
  - **4N1R1**: On the 4th rank, there's a White Knight on the e-file and a White Rook on the g-file.
  - **6K1**: On the 2nd rank, the White King is on the g-file.
  - **w**: It's White's turn to move.
  - **- - 0 1**: There are no castling rights available for either side, there are no en passant captures available, the number of moves since the last pawn move or capture is 0, and this is the first move of the game.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for White:
1. **White Knight on e4**: The Knight can potentially move to c3, c5, d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, or g5. Let's check which of these are valid:
   - c3, d2, f2, g3 are not possible due to being occupied by other pieces or being off the board for other reasons.
   - c5 and d6 are valid as there are no pieces on those squares.
   - f6 is potentially valid as there's no piece on that square.
   - g5 is potentially valid.

2. **White Rook on g4**: The Rook can move along the g-file or along the 4th rank. 
   - It can move up or down on the g-file, but it's blocked by the Black King on g8 and can potentially move to g7 or g6 if not for the Black pawns.
   - It can move left on the 4th rank to h4, f4, e4 (but e4 is occupied by the White Knight), d4, c4, b4, or a4.

3. **White King on g2**: The King can potentially move to f2, f1, h2, or h1.

Let's check for valid moves:
- The White Knight can move to c5, d6, f6, or g5. 
  - Nc5, Nd6, Nf6, and Ng5 are potential moves.
- The White Rook on g4 can move to g7 (capturing the pawn), g6, or along the 4th rank to h4, f4, e4 (not possible due to the Knight), d4, c4, b4, a4.
  - Rg7, Rg6, Rh4, Rf4 are potential moves.
- The White King can move to f2, f1, h2, h1.
  - Kf2, Kf1, Kh2, Kh1 are potential moves.

Let's pick a valid move. One simple valid move is **Rg7**, capturing the pawn.

To output this in PGN format, we start with the move number, followed by the move. Since it's White's first move, we start with "1.".

The move is Rg7.
