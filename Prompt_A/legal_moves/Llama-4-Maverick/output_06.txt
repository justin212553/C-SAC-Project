To solve this problem, let's analyze the given FEN position: **k7/8/8/1pp3b1/2p5/K7/7r/8 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what the FEN notation tells us. The position is:
- Black king on a8
- Black pawns on b5, c5, and c4
- Black bishop on f5
- Black rook on h2
- White king on a3

Given it's black's turn (indicated by 'b'), we need to analyze all possible moves for black.

1. **Black King (a8):** The king can move to a7 or b8 (if it were not for other pieces, but we need to check if these squares are under attack or occupied). However, we need to check the adjacent squares for potential moves. The king is somewhat safe on a8 for the moment.

2. **Black Pawns:**
   - The pawn on b5 can potentially move to b4.
   - The pawn on c5 can potentially move to c4, but it's already on c4's adjacent square, so it can move to c3.
   - The pawn on c4 can move to c3.

3. **Black Bishop (f5):** The bishop can potentially move along its available diagonals. The available moves depend on the diagonals it's on. It can move to e6, d7, or e4, g4, g6, h7, etc., if those squares were not occupied or under attack. Let's check the diagonals: it can potentially move to e4, e6, d7, g4, g6, or h7. e4 and e6 are potential moves since they are not blocked by other black pieces.

4. **Black Rook (h2):** The rook can move along the second rank or the h-file. Potential moves include h1, h3, g2, f2, e2, d2. Let's check these: h1, h3 are potential moves. g2 is also a potential move.

Let's examine the potential moves more closely:
- The black king can move to b8 or a7. 
- b5 pawn can move to b4.
- c5 pawn is blocked by c4 pawn and can't move forward; it can potentially capture if there were a piece on d4, but there isn't.
- c4 pawn can move to c3.
- The bishop on f5 can move to various squares on the diagonal, such as e4, e6, d7, g4, g6, h7. e4 and g6 are valid since they are not blocked.
- The rook on h2 can move to h1, h3, or along the second rank towards the files.

Let's directly check for a valid move:
- The rook can move to h1 or h3. 
- The bishop can move to e4 or e6.

One valid move is **1... Rh1**.

Let's format this as per PGN notation.

1... Rh1+ 2.Ka2 Rh8# 
is not needed; we just need one valid move.
