To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given FEN position and identify a legal move for Black.

The given FEN is: **1k6/1p6/5r2/3q2p1/Qp1P4/4PrPp/2R4P/R5K1 b - - 0 1**

Let's break down the position:

- The board is set up with Black to move, as indicated by 'b'.
- The position of the pieces is as follows:
  - Black: King on c8 (implied, as the 'k' is on the 8th rank and there's no other 'k'), 'b' pawn on b7, 'r' rook on f6, 'q' queen on d5, 'p' pawn on g5, 'r' rook on f3, 'p' pawns on b4 and h3 (implied, though 'h3' is not directly given, we see 'p' on the 'h' file is on h3), and 'p' pawn on g3.
  - White: 'Q' queen on a4, 'R' rooks on c2 and a1 (implied, though not directly on a1, 'R' is on the 'a' file and 1st rank), 'P' pawns on d4 and g2 (implied, as 'P' is on the 'g' file and 'g2' is the only available spot for it), 'P' pawn on h2.

Let's analyze the Black pieces to find a legal move:
1. The Black King is on b8 (since '1k6' implies the 'k' is on the 'b' file and 8th rank, so b8).
   - The King can move from b8 to a7 or c7 or a8.

2. The Black pawn on b7 can move to b6 or b5.
   - b7-b6 or b7-b5 are possible.

3. The Black rook on f6 can potentially move along the 'f' file or along the 6th rank.
   - It can move to f8, f7 (if the square is not under attack or occupied), or potentially along the 6th rank if not blocked or under attack.

4. The Black queen on d5 has various potential moves along the 'd' file or the 5th rank.
   - It can potentially move to any square along the 'd' file or the 5th rank not blocked by other pieces or under attack.

5. The Black pawn on g5 can potentially move to g4.

6. The Black rook on f3 is somewhat restricted due to the White pawn on g2 (implied to be on g2 or potentially captured if on g3) and the presence of other pieces.
   - It can potentially move along the 'f' file.

7. The Black pawns on b4, g3, and h3 are somewhat restricted. 
   - The 'b4' pawn can potentially capture 'a3' if it were White's piece, but there's no White piece on 'a3'. The 'g3' pawn is somewhat restricted due to being on 'g3', and 'h3' is similarly somewhat fixed.

Let's directly examine a simple move:
- The Black King can move to a7 or c7 or a8. Let's consider **1... Kb8-a7** or **1... Kb8-c7** or **1... Kb8-a8**. All are valid.

Let's directly check one of these:
- **1... Ka7** is a valid move in PGN notation.

Let's directly output the PGN for one of the valid moves.
