To solve this problem, let's analyze the given FEN position: **6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand what the FEN notation tells us. The given FEN is broken down as follows:
- **6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8**: This part describes the position of the pieces on the board.
  - The rows are described from the 8th rank (black's starting rank) to the 1st rank (white's starting rank).
  - '6k1' means there is a black king on the g8 square, and there are 6 empty squares followed by 1 empty square on the 8th rank.
  - '5ppp' means there are 5 empty squares followed by 3 black pawns on the 7th rank.
  - '8' means the 6th rank is empty.
  - '4R3' means there are 4 empty squares followed by a white rook on the e5 square and then 3 empty squares on the 5th rank.
  - '1K6' means there is 1 white king on the b4 square followed by 6 empty squares on the 4th rank.
  - The remaining ranks (3rd to 1st) are empty.
- **w**: It's white's turn to move.
- **- -**: There are no en passant captures possible, and there is no specific information about the number of moves since the last pawn move or capture for the 50-move rule.
- **0 1**: The number of moves since the last capture or pawn move is 0, and it's the 1st move.

Let's analyze the position:
- White King is on b4.
- White Rook is on e5.
- Black King is on g8.
- Black pawns are on f7, g7, and h7.

The task is to find a legal move for white.

1. **White King (b4) can move**: The king can potentially move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) one square. The possible moves are to a3, a4, a5, c3, c4, c5. We need to check if these moves are valid (not into check, and not onto a square occupied by another white piece or a square that would put it into check from an opponent's piece).

2. **White Rook (e5) can move**: The rook can move horizontally or vertically. It can potentially move to any square on the e-file or the 5th rank that is not occupied by another white piece. So, it can move to e1, e2, e3, e4, e6, e7, e8, or d5, c5, b5, a5.

Let's check for valid moves:
- The white king on b4 can move to a3, a4, a5, c3, c4, or c5. All these moves are valid as they don't put the king into check or on a square occupied by another white piece.
- The white rook on e5 can move along the 5th rank or the e-file. It can capture black pawns or move to empty squares.

Let's consider a simple move:
- The rook can move to e7, capturing a pawn, which is a straightforward and valid move.

To make a move, let's choose a valid and straightforward one: **Re7**.

Now, let's format this move into PGN.
