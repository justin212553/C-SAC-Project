To solve this, let's analyze the given FEN position: **r5k1/pb4bp/1p1N1pp1/3nN3/3p4/P2Q2Pq/1P3P1P/R1B1rBK1 b - - 0 1**

First, we need to understand the position:
- The board is set up with Black to move.
- The FEN notation gives us the current state of the board.

Let's decode the FEN:
- **r5k1/pb4bp/1p1N1pp1/3nN3/3p4/P2Q2Pq/1P3P1P/R1B1rBK1**: This is the position of the pieces.
  - **r**: Black Rook
  - **b**: Black Bishop
  - **n**: Black Knight
  - **p**: Black Pawn
  - **N**: White Knight
  - **Q**: White Queen
  - **B**: White Bishop
  - **R**: White Rook
  - **K**: White King (and also Black King, depending on the case)
  - **q**: Black Queen (in this case, the 'q' represents the Black Queen on h3)
  - The numbers represent empty squares.
- **b**: Indicates it's Black's turn to move.
- **-**: No castling rights for either side.
- **-**: No en passant square.
- **0**: Halfmove clock (for the 50-move rule).
- **1**: Fullmove number.

Let's analyze the position:
1. Black is to move.
2. The Black King is on g8, and it's not in check.
3. We need to find a legal move for Black.

Looking at the pieces:
- The Black Rook on a8 can move.
- The Black Bishop on b7 can move.
- The Black Knight on d5 can move.
- The Black Pawns on b6, f6, and g6 can potentially move.
- The Black Queen on h3 can move.
- The Black Rook on e1 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move.

Let's check for simple moves:
- The Black Queen on h3 is under attack by the White Queen on d3. Moving the Queen is a good idea.
- The Black Knight on d5 is a good piece to consider, as it's centrally located and has potential moves.

One simple and legal move is to move the Black Queen from h3 to a more safe square. Let's consider **Qg4**, moving the Queen to g4. It's a valid move as g4 is not occupied by a Black piece, and it's a safe square for the Queen to potentially escape the White Queen's potential capture or pin.

Let's verify if **Qg4** is a valid move:
- h3 is the current position of the Black Queen.
- g4 is a valid destination.

To provide the PGN, we first need to establish the move number and the color. Since it's Black's turn and the fullmove number is 1, it indicates this is the first move for Black, so the move number is 1 for White (though we're not making a White move) and 1 for Black.

Thus, the PGN for the move **Qh3-g4** would be: **1... Qg4**

[FINAL PGN]
1... Qg4
