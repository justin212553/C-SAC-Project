To solve this problem, let's first understand the given position using the FEN notation: **8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1**.

Breaking down the FEN:
- The position is: 8th rank is empty, 7th rank has a black king on g7, 6th rank is empty, 5th rank has a black knight on e5 and a black rook on g5, 4th and 3rd ranks are empty, 2nd rank has white pawns on f2 and g2 and h2, and 1st rank has white rooks on f1 and g1 and a white king on h1.
- It's black's turn to move (indicated by 'b').
- There are no en passant opportunities (indicated by '-').
- There are no half-moves since the last capture or pawn move (indicated by the second '-').
- The number of moves since the start of the game is not directly relevant, but the current move number is 1.

Now, let's analyze the position:
1. The black king is on g7.
2. The black knight is on e5.
3. The black rook is on g5.

Let's examine possible moves for black:
- The black king (g7) can potentially move to f6, f7, f8, h6, h7, or h8. So, Kg7-f7, Kg7-f8, Kg7-h6, Kg7-h8 are potential moves. Kg7-f6 and Kg7-h7 are also valid.
- The black knight (e5) can move to c4, c6, d3, d7, f3, f7, g4, or g6. So, Ne5-c4, Ne5-c6, Ne5-d3, Ne5-d7, Ne5-f3, Ne5-f7, Ne5-g4, Ne5-g6 are potential moves.
- The black rook (g5) can move along the g-file or along the 5th rank. So, Rg5-g1, Rg5-g2, Rg5-g3, Rg5-g4, Rg5-g6, Rg5-g7, Rg5-g8, Rg5-e5 are potential moves.

Let's check for any immediate checks or captures:
- The white king is on h1, and it's relatively safe with the rooks supporting it.
- The black rook on g5 is somewhat active but can potentially be more effective or safe on other squares.

Let's directly check for a valid move:
- One simple and valid move is to move the black king. Let's consider Kg7-h8 or Kg7-f8. Both are valid.

Let's choose Kg7-h8 as our move. In PGN notation, this is written as "1... Kh8".

However, the correct notation for the move Kg7-h8 is "1... Kg7h8" or simply using the standard algebraic notation directly.

Let's directly output the PGN for the chosen move.
