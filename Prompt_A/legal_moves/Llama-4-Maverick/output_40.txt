To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given FEN position and identify a legal move for Black.

The given FEN is: **r3k2r/pQ3pp1/2p3q1/3n4/1n1P2bp/4P3/1P1NNPPP/R1B1KB1R b - - 0 1**

Let's break down the position:
- The board is set up with Black to move, as indicated by 'b'.
- The position of the pieces is as follows:
  - Black: Rook on a8, King on e8, Rook on h8, Queen on g6, Knight on d5, Knight on b4, Bishop on g4, pawn on c6, pawns on f7 and g7, and a pawn on p7 (which is likely a7 or h7, but given the context, it's likely one of the pawns is on a7).
  - White: Queen on b7, Knight on e2, Knight on d2, Bishop on c1, King on e1, Rook on h1, pawns on d4, e3, b2, and pawns on f2, g2, and h2.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for Black:
1. **Rook on a8**: Can potentially move to a7 (if it were not for the Queen on b7), but more likely can move along the rank or file if not obstructed. However, a8 is somewhat restricted.
2. **King on e8**: Can potentially castle with the Rook on h8 if the conditions for castling are met (King and Rook involved haven't moved, no pieces between them, not in check, and not crossing a square under attack).
3. **Rook on h8**: Can potentially castle with the King.
4. **Queen on g6**: Can move to various squares along the file or rank. It can potentially move to g2, g3, g4 (capture), g5, g7 (if safe), f5, e6, d6, c6 (capture), b6, and a6.
5. **Knight on d5**: Can potentially move to b6, c7, e7, f6, f4, b4 (already occupied by another Black Knight, so not a valid move).
6. **Knight on b4**: Can potentially move to a6, c2 (if safe), d3 (if safe), d5 (already occupied, so not a valid move).
7. **Bishop on g4**: Can potentially move along the diagonal to f3, f5, h3, h5, e6, d7, c8.

Let's check for a simple, valid move:
- The Queen on g6 can move. For example, Qg6-g2 is not possible due to being on the opposite side of the board and potentially being obstructed or not a valid target. However, a move like Qg7 is not valid because g7 is occupied by a pawn. A valid move could be Qg6-g5 or Qg6-e6 or Qg6xd6 (capturing on d6 if it were safe and not obstructed).

Let's examine a potential move: **Qg6-e6**. The Queen moves from g6 to e6. This is a valid move as it follows the rules of how a Queen can move.

To verify if this is a valid PGN move:
1. The current move is Black's first move.
2. The move is Qg6-e6.

The PGN notation for the move is **1... Qe6**.

Let's check if the King is in check or if there's a more straightforward move. The King is not directly in check.

Let's directly output the PGN for the move **Qg6-e6**.
