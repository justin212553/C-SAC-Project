To analyze the given position and determine a legal move, let's first understand the position using the provided FEN notation: **6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1**

Breaking down the FEN:
- The position is: Black King on g8, White Rook on c7, Black pawns on e6, f6, g6, White King on g4, White pawn on f4, White Queen on e3, White pawn on a3, White pawn on g3, Black Queen on b2, Black Rook on g2.
- It's Black's turn to move.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for Black:
1. **Black King (g8):** The King can move to f8 or h8 (since moving to g7 is not possible due to the White Rook's potential influence and the presence of Black pawns, but directly it's not under attack from White pieces directly adjacent). However, we need to check if these moves are legal by seeing if they put the King in check.
   
2. **Black Queen (b2):** The Queen can move along the ranks, files, or diagonals. It can potentially move to any square on the second rank (a2, c2, d2, etc.), along the 'b' file (b1, b3, b4, etc.), or diagonally. Checking the second rank, it can move to a2 or c2. On the 'b' file, it can move to b1, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8. Diagonally, it has options like a1.

3. **Black pawns (e6, f6, g6):** 
   - The pawn on e6 can potentially move to e5.
   - The pawn on f6 can move to f5.
   - The pawn on g6 can move to g5.

4. **Black Rook (g2):** The Rook can move along the 'g' file or the second rank. On the 'g' file, it can move to g1, g3, g4 (capturing the White King, which is not a valid move as you cannot capture the King directly), g5, g6 (capturing the pawn), g7, g8. On the second rank, it can move to a2, b2 (occupied by the Black Queen), c2, d2, e2, f2, h2.

Let's directly look for a simple, legal move:
- The Black Queen on b2 can move to a2 or c2. Both are potential moves.
- The Black Rook on g2 can move to g1, g3 (not possible because g3 is occupied by a White pawn and g4 is occupied by the White King, so g3 is not a valid move due to being blocked by a pawn), g5, g6 (capturing a pawn), g7, g8. So, g1, g6, g7, g8 are valid options.

Let's consider a simple move like **Qb2-a2** or **Rg2-g7**.

For **Qb2-a2:** It's a valid move as it doesn't put the Black King in check or capture the White King directly.

For **Rg2-g7:** It's also a valid move as it captures the White Rook on c7.

Let's evaluate if these moves are check or checkmate:
- **Qb2-a2** is a valid move and doesn't directly check the White King.
- **Rg2-g7** captures the White Rook on c7 and is a valid move.

Let's choose **Qb2-a2** for simplicity.

The current move number is 1 (for Black, as indicated by the FEN), and since it's Black's turn, we directly provide the move.
