To solve this, let's first understand the given position using the FEN notation: **r5k1/2R3pp/5p2/1p2p3/2b1p3/6P1/5P1P/6KN b - - 0 1**

Breaking down the FEN:
- **r5k1**: Black's Rook, empty squares, King, empty square.
- **2R3pp**: White's Rook on the c-file, empty squares, Black's pawns on g and h files.
- **5p2**: Empty squares, Black's pawn, empty squares.
- **1p2p3**: Black's pawn, empty squares, Black's pawn, empty squares.
- **2b1p3**: Black's Bishop, empty square, Black's pawn, empty squares.
- **6P1**: Empty squares, White's pawn on g-file.
- **5P1P**: Empty squares, White's pawns on f and h files.
- **6KN**: Empty squares, White's King, White's Knight.

The position is Black's turn (indicated by 'b'). We need to analyze the possible moves for Black.

1. **Black's King (k) on g8**: The King can potentially move to f8, h8, or h7 if not for any other pieces or checks to consider. However, we need to check if these moves are legal.

2. **Black's Rook (r) on a8**: The Rook can move along the 8th rank or down the 'a' file. It can potentially move to a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1, b8, or c8, d8, e8, f8, g8.

3. **Black's Bishop (b) on c4**: The Bishop can move along the diagonals it's on. Potential moves are b3, a2, d3, e2, d5, e6.

4. **Black's pawns**: 
   - The pawn on f6 can potentially move to f5.
   - The pawn on g7 can potentially move to g6 or g5.
   - The pawn on h7 can potentially move to h6 or h5.
   - The pawn on b5 can potentially move to b4.
   - The pawn on e5 can potentially move to e4.
   - The pawn on e4 can potentially move to e3.

Let's check for any immediate restrictions or obvious moves:
- The White Rook on c7 is somewhat restricting Black's movements on the 7th rank.
- The White King is on g1, and the Knight is on h1, so they are somewhat safe for now.

Let's directly analyze potential moves:
- The Rook on a8 can move. For example, Ra7 or Rd8 could be potential moves, but we need to check if they are valid.
- The Bishop on c4 can potentially move to a2, b3, d3, e2, d5, or e6. Let's check if any of these are valid.
- Pawns have limited mobility due to their positions and potential blocks or captures.

One simple and valid move is **1... Rd8**. The Rook can move to d8, which is a valid and straightforward move.

Let's check if there are any other simple moves:
- **1... h6** or **1... h5** are possible pawn moves.
- **1... g6** or **1... g5** are also possible.

However, we need to identify a single valid move. Let's directly verify the move **1... Rd8**.

The move **1... Rd8** involves moving the Rook from a8 to d8. This is a valid move as there are no pieces on d8 that would prevent this move (the square is empty), and it's along the rank, which is a valid direction for a Rook to move.

Therefore, a valid PGN move is: 

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rd8
[FINAL PGN] is not needed as per the format; the correct format is just the PGN.

[FINAL PGN]1... Rd8[/FINAL PGN] is still not correct. The correct format should be:

[FINAL PGN]
1... Rd8
