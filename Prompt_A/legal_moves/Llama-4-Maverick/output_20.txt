To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given FEN notation and the position it represents on the chessboard.

The given FEN is: **2R5/1KP1R3/1PnP1Q1P/Pn1q2P1/p4P2/8/1pp2ppp/1k1r4 b - - 0 1**

Let's break down the FEN:
- **2R5**: The eighth rank (black's back rank) has a white Rook on c8, and the rest are empty.
- **1KP1R3**: The seventh rank has a white King on b7, a white Pawn on c7, a white Rook on e7.
- **1PnP1Q1P**: The sixth rank has a black Pawn on b6, a white Pawn on c6, a black Knight on d6, a white Pawn on e6, a white Queen on f6, a white Pawn on g6.
- **Pn1q2P1**: The fifth rank has a white Pawn on a5, a black Knight on b5, a black Queen on d5, a white Pawn on g5.
- **p4P2**: The fourth rank has a black Pawn on a4, and a white Pawn on e4.
- **8**: The third rank is empty.
- **1pp2ppp**: The second rank has a white Pawn on b2, and black Pawns on c2, f2, g2, h2.
- **1k1r4**: The first rank (white's back rank) has a black King on b1, a black Rook on d1.

The position is black's turn to move.

Let's analyze the moveable pieces for Black:
1. **Black King on b1**: It can move to a1, a2, or c1, but we need to check if these moves are legal.
2. **Black Queen on d5**: It can potentially move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) if there are no obstructions or if it's not putting the King in check.
3. **Black Knight on b5**: It can move to a3, c3, d4, d6, or potentially capture on a7 if it were on a7 (not possible here).
4. **Black Knight on d6**: It can potentially move to other squares (b5, b7, c4, c8, e4, e8, f5, f7).
5. **Black Rook on d1**: It can move along the d-file or along the first rank if not obstructed.
6. **Black Pawns**: 
   - **a4**: Can potentially move to a3.
   - **c2**: Can potentially move to c1.
   - **b2, f2, g2, h2**: Can potentially move to b1, f1, g1, h1 (if not obstructed) or move forward one or two steps if on their starting position.

Let's directly check for a valid move:
- The Black King is on b1, and it can move to a2 or c1. Moving to a1 is not possible due to the presence of the Pawn on a4 and potentially being obstructed or not a safe move, but primarily because a2 is a valid move.
- The Black Queen on d5 is somewhat restricted but can potentially move.
- The Black Rook on d1 can potentially move along the d-file.

One simple and valid move is **Kd1** (King moves to d1). Let's verify:
- The King is on b1 and can move to d1 as it's along the first rank.

Let's check if **1... Kd1** is a valid PGN notation for this move.

The move is for Black, and it's the first move for Black in this position, so it should be preceded by the move number and followed by the move.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Kd1
[FINAL PGN] is not needed as per the format; the correct format is just the PGN after the tag.
