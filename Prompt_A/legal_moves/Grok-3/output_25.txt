--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **2R5/kp3r1q/p4Q2/P3P1B1/K7/8/5b2/8 w - - 0 1**. This represents the current state of the board, with White to move. My task is to find one legal move for White, focusing solely on White's pieces and their possible moves, without considering Black's responses.

First, I decode the FEN to visualize the board:
- 8th rank: 2 empty squares, Rook (R), 5 empty squares.
- 7th rank: king (k), pawn (p), 3 empty squares, rook (r), 1 empty square, queen (q).
- 6th rank: pawn (p), 4 empty squares, Queen (Q), 2 empty squares.
- 5th rank: Pawn (P), 3 empty squares, Pawn (P), 1 empty square, Bishop (B), 1 empty square.
- 4th rank: King (K), 7 empty squares.
- 3rd rank: 8 empty squares.
- 2nd rank: 5 empty squares, bishop (b), 2 empty squares.
- 1st rank: 8 empty squares.

White's pieces are:
- King on a4.
- Queen on f6.
- Rook on c8.
- Bishop on g5.
- Pawns on a5 and e5.

Since it's White's turn, I will list all possible legal moves for each of White's pieces.

1. **King on a4**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to b5, b4, b3, a3, or a5. However, a5 is occupied by White's own pawn, so that's not possible. Checking the other squares:
   - b5, b4, b3, a3 are empty, so the King can move to any of these squares. I must ensure the King isn't moving into check, but since the task is to find one legal move and not to consider opponent's moves, I can assume these are legal for now.

2. **Queen on f6**: The Queen can move any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Checking the board:
   - Vertically up to f7 (occupied by Black's rook) or f8 (empty).
   - Vertically down to f5, f4, f3, f2, f1 (all empty).
   - Horizontally left to e6, d6, c6, b6, a6 (all empty).
   - Horizontally right to g6, h6 (empty).
   - Diagonally up-left to e7 (empty), d8 (empty).
   - Diagonally up-right to g7 (empty), h8 (empty).
   - Diagonally down-left to e5 (occupied by White's pawn, so blocked).
   - Diagonally down-right to g5 (occupied by White's bishop, so blocked).
   The Queen can also capture the Black rook on f7. So, possible moves include f7 (capture), f8, f5, f4, f3, f2, f1, e6, d6, c6, b6, a6, g6, h6, e7, d8, g7, h8.

3. **Rook on c8**: The Rook can move vertically or horizontally any number of squares.
   - Vertically down to c7, c6, c5, c4, c3, c2, c1 (all empty).
   - Horizontally left to b8, a8 (empty).
   - Horizontally right to d8, e8, f8, g8, h8 (empty).
   So, possible moves are c7, c6, c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, b8, a8, d8, e8, f8, g8, h8.

4. **Bishop on g5**: The Bishop can move diagonally any number of squares.
   - Diagonally up-left to f6 (occupied by White's Queen, so blocked).
   - Diagonally up-right to h6 (empty).
   - Diagonally down-left to f4, e3, d2, c1 (all empty).
   - Diagonally down-right to h4 (empty).
   So, possible moves are h6, f4, e3, d2, c1, h4.

5. **Pawn on a5**: Pawns move forward one square (or two from the starting position, but this pawn has likely moved already). Forward for White is toward rank 8, so from a5 to a6 (empty). It cannot move two squares since it's not on its starting rank. No captures are possible since there are no Black pieces on b6.
   So, possible move is a6.

6. **Pawn on e5**: Similarly, this pawn can move to e6 (empty). No captures possible since f6 has White's Queen and d6 is empty.
   So, possible move is e6.

I have now listed all possible moves for White's pieces. The task is to provide just one legal move. Since the goal is straightforward, I can choose any of these moves. For simplicity, I will select a move that is clear and unambiguous. Let's go with moving the Queen to f7, capturing the Black rook, as it involves a capture and is a significant move. I need to ensure the notation is correct. The move is Queen to f7, capturing the rook, so in PGN it should be Qxf7. I should check if this puts the White King in check or if it's illegal, but since the instruction is to not consider opponent's moves, I assume it's legal for the purpose of this task.

To confirm, I note that the King is on a4, and moving the Queen to f7 doesn't directly expose the King since the Queen was not guarding a critical square relative to the King. Black's pieces (like the Queen on h7 or rook on f7) might threaten after the move, but again, I'm not to consider that.

Thus, one legal move is Qxf7.

[FINAL PGN]
1. Qxf7
