--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **4r3/5r2/3p1p2/1P6/8/K1p5/P1k5/8 b - - 0 1**. This indicates it is Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup:

- Black pieces:
  - King on c2
  - Rooks on e8 and f7
  - Pawns on c3, d6, and f6
- White pieces:
  - King on a3
  - Pawns on a2 and b5

My task is to find one legal move for Black. Since the goal is simply to identify a legal move, I will focus on identifying all possible moves for Black's pieces without considering the opponent's response or deeper strategy.

1. **Black King on c2**: The king can move to any adjacent square that is not under attack or occupied by a Black piece. Possible squares are b1, b2, b3, c1, d1, d2, d3. However, I need to ensure the king does not move into check. Let's check if any of these squares are attacked by White:
   - White's king on a3 can attack b2 and b3.
   - White's pawn on a2 can attack b3.
   - White's pawn on b5 does not attack any squares near the Black king.
   Thus, b2 and b3 are under attack by the White king, and b3 is also attacked by the a2 pawn. The remaining squares (b1, c1, d1, d2, d3) need to be checked for safety, but since White has no other pieces attacking these squares, they appear safe. So, possible king moves are: Kc2-b1, Kc2-c1, Kc2-d1, Kc2-d2, Kc2-d3.

2. **Black Rook on e8**: The rook can move along the e-file or the 8th rank. Possible moves:
   - Along the e-file: e7, e6, e5, e4, e3, e2, e1 (no pieces blocking).
   - Along the 8th rank: d8, c8, b8, a8 (no pieces blocking).
   So, possible moves are: Re8-e7, Re8-e6, Re8-e5, Re8-e4, Re8-e3, Re8-e2, Re8-e1, Re8-d8, Re8-c8, Re8-b8, Re8-a8.

3. **Black Rook on f7**: The rook can move along the f-file or the 7th rank. Possible moves:
   - Along the f-file: f8 (up), f6 (down, but blocked by Black pawn on f6, so not possible beyond f6).
   - Along the 7th rank: e7, d7, c7, b7, a7 (no pieces blocking).
   So, possible moves are: Rf7-f8, Rf7-e7, Rf7-d7, Rf7-c7, Rf7-b7, Rf7-a7.

4. **Black Pawn on c3**: The pawn can move forward to c2, but c2 is occupied by the Black king, so this move is not possible. It cannot capture anything as there are no White pieces on b2 or d2. So, no moves for this pawn.

5. **Black Pawn on d6**: The pawn can move forward to d5 (no pieces blocking). It cannot capture anything as there are no White pieces on c5 or e5. So, possible move: d6-d5.

6. **Black Pawn on f6**: The pawn can move forward to f5 (no pieces blocking). It cannot capture anything as there are no White pieces on e5 or g5. So, possible move: f6-f5.

Summarizing, Black has numerous legal moves available:
- King moves: Kc2-b1, Kc2-c1, Kc2-d1, Kc2-d2, Kc2-d3
- Rook on e8 moves: Re8-e7, Re8-e6, Re8-e5, Re8-e4, Re8-e3, Re8-e2, Re8-e1, Re8-d8, Re8-c8, Re8-b8, Re8-a8
- Rook on f7 moves: Rf7-f8, Rf7-e7, Rf7-d7, Rf7-c7, Rf7-b7, Rf7-a7
- Pawn moves: d6-d5, f6-f5

Since the task is to provide just one legal move, I will choose a simple and straightforward move. I’ll select moving the Black pawn from d6 to d5, as it is a basic pawn advance and does not immediately alter the position drastically.
