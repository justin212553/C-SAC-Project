--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **8/6k1/8/4n1r1/8/8/5PPP/5RKR b - - 0 1**. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup.

- **Black pieces**: King on g7, Knight on e5, Rook on g5.
- **White pieces**: King on h1, Rook on f1, Rook on g1, Pawns on f2, g2, and h2.

My task is to find one legal move for Black. I will examine each of Black's pieces and determine their possible moves without considering White's responses, as per the instructions.

1. **Black King on g7**: The King can move one square in any direction. Let's check the adjacent squares:
   - f8, f7, f6, g8, g6, h8, h7, h6.
   - All these squares are empty and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats from White pieces that I need to consider for legality (as per the instruction to only consider my moves). Thus, the King can move to any of these 8 squares: Kg7-f8, Kg7-f7, Kg7-f6, Kg7-g8, Kg7-g6, Kg7-h8, Kg7-h7, Kg7-h6.

2. **Black Knight on e5**: The Knight moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and one perpendicular, or vice versa). Possible squares from e5 are:
   - c6, c4, d7, d3, f7, f3, g6, g4.
   - Checking the board, all these squares are empty. Thus, the Knight can move to any of these 8 squares: Ne5-c6, Ne5-c4, Ne5-d7, Ne5-d3, Ne5-f7, Ne5-f3, Ne5-g6, Ne5-g4.

3. **Black Rook on g5**: The Rook moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares. From g5, possible moves are:
   - Horizontally: g1 to g4, g6 to g8 (but g1, g2 are occupied by White pieces, so only g3, g4, g6, g7, g8 are possible until blocked).
     - g7 is occupied by Black King, so g7 and g8 are not possible.
     - Thus, horizontally: g3, g4, g6.
   - Vertically: a5 to h5 (check columns).
     - a5, b5, c5, d5, f5, h5 are empty (e5 is occupied by Black Knight, so stop at d5 and f5).
     - Thus, vertically: a5, b5, c5, d5, f5, h5.
   - Total Rook moves: Rg5-g3, Rg5-g4, Rg5-g6, Rg5-a5, Rg5-b5, Rg5-c5, Rg5-d5, Rg5-f5, Rg5-h5.

I have identified multiple legal moves for Black: 8 for the King, 8 for the Knight, and 9 for the Rook, totaling 25 possible moves. Since the task is to provide just one legal move, I will select a simple and straightforward one. Let's choose a King move, as it is the least likely to complicate the position unnecessarily for this exercise. I will pick **Kg7-h7**, moving the King one square to the side.

I should also check if this move is legal in terms of not moving into check, even though the instruction says to only consider my moves. Let's briefly verify if h7 is under attack by White:
- White Rook on f1 can move to f7, not h7.
- White Rook on g1 can move to g7, not h7.
- White King on h1 can't reach h7 in one move.
- White Pawns on f2, g2, h2 can't attack h7 (pawn attacks are diagonal, and h7 is not in their range yet).
So, h7 is safe, and Kg7-h7 is a legal move.

Thus, my chosen move is **Kg7-h7**. Since it's Black's turn and the move number isn't specified in the FEN beyond "0 1", I will assume it's move 1 for notation purposes, but in PGN, I will denote it with the appropriate ellipsis if needed. Given it's Black to move, it might be the second half of a move pair, but since it's not specified, I'll write it as is.
