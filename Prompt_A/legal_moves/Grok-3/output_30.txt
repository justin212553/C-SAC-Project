--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: r5k1/pb4bp/1p1N1pp1/3nN3/3p4/P2Q2Pq/1P3P1P/R1B1rBK1 b - - 0 1. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. My task is to find one legal move for Black, focusing solely on Black's pieces and their possible moves without considering White's responses or future moves.

First, I identify Black's pieces on the board and their positions:
- King on g8
- Rook on a8
- Rook on e1
- Bishop on b7
- Bishop on g7
- Knight on d5
- Queen on h3
- Pawns on a7, b6, d4, f6, and g6

Next, I systematically check each piece for legal moves, ensuring they adhere to chess rules and do not leave the king in check unless it's a valid move.

1. **King on g8**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are f8, f7, g7, and h7, h8. However, g7 is occupied by Black's own bishop, so it's not a legal move. I need to check if moving to f8, f7, h7, or h8 puts the king in check, but since the task is to find one legal move and not necessarily the best, I can consider any move that is legal. For now, I note that Kg8-f8, Kg8-f7, Kg8-h7, and Kg8-h8 are potential moves, pending a check verification.

2. **Rook on a8**: The rook can move along the a-file or the 8th rank. The a-file is open down to a1, and the 8th rank is open to b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, but g8 is occupied by the king. So possible moves are Ra8 to a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1, or b8, c8, d8, e8, f8. These are all potential legal moves unless they expose the king to check, which I will verify if needed.

3. **Rook on e1**: This rook is on the 1st rank. It can move along the e-file or the 1st rank. On the e-file, e2, e3, e4 are open, but e5 is blocked by White's knight on e5. On the 1st rank, it can move to d1, c1, b1, a1 (left) or f1 (right, since g1 is occupied by White's king and h1 by White's pawn). However, moving to f1 attacks White's king on g1, which would be check, so I note Re1-f1+ as a potential move. Other moves like Re1-e2, e3, e4, or to d1, c1, b1, a1 are also possible.

4. **Bishop on b7**: This bishop is on the a8-h1 diagonal. It can move to a6, c6, d5, e4, f3, g2, h1. However, d5 is occupied by Black's knight, so it's blocked there. Moves to a6, c6, e4, f3, g2, h1 are possible, with g2 and h1 attacking White's king on g1, so Bb7-g2+ and Bb7-h1+ are checks. I note these as potential moves.

5. **Bishop on g7**: This bishop is on the a1-h8 diagonal. It can move to f8, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1. However, e5 is occupied by White's knight, and d4 by Black's pawn, so it's blocked beyond f8. Thus, only Bg7-f8 is a possible move.

6. **Knight on d5**: The knight can move to eight potential squares: b6, b4, c7, c3, e7, e3, f6, f4. However, b6 and f6 are occupied by Black's pawns, so those are not possible. The remaining moves are Nd5-b4, Nd5-c7, Nd5-c3, Nd5-e7, Nd5-e3, Nd5-f4. I note these as legal moves.

7. **Queen on h3**: The queen can move in any direction. Along the h-file: h4, h5, h6, h7, h8. Along the 3rd rank: g3, f3, e3, d3, c3, b3, a3. Diagonally: g4, f5, e6, d7, c8 (one diagonal), and g2, f1 (other diagonal). Notably, moving to g2 or f1 attacks White's king on g1, so Qh3-g2+ and Qh3-f1+ are checks. All these moves are potential legal moves.

8. **Pawns**:
   - Pawn on a7: Can move to a6 or capture on b6 if possible, but b6 is occupied by Black's pawn, so only a7-a6.
   - Pawn on b6: Can move to b5 or capture on a5 or c5, but no enemy pieces there, so only b6-b5.
   - Pawn on d4: Can move to d3 or capture on c3 or e3, but no enemy pieces, so only d4-d3.
   - Pawn on f6: Can move to f5 or capture on e5 or g5, e5 has White's knight, so f6xe5 is a capture, and f6-f5 is also possible.
   - Pawn on g6: Can move to g5 or capture on f5 or h5, but no enemy pieces, so only g6-g5.

At this point, I have identified numerous legal moves for Black. Since the task is to find just one legal move, I can select any of these. To ensure simplicity, I will pick a straightforward move that doesn't require deep calculation of check or future implications, as the instruction is to focus only on my move for this turn.

I choose the move **Re1-f1+**, which moves the rook from e1 to f1, putting White's king in check. This is a clear legal move, as the path is open, and it directly attacks the opponent's king, fitting the rules of chess.

Therefore, my selected move for Black is Re1-f1+.

[FINAL PGN]
1... Re1f1+
