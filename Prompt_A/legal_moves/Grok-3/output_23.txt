--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given position using the provided FEN: r4r1k/p5Rp/1p3pb1/2P4N/2B5/P7/6PP/B2n2K1 w - - 0 1. This indicates that it is White's turn to move. My task is to find one legal move for White, focusing solely on White's pieces and their possible moves without considering Black's responses.

First, I identify all of White's pieces on the board and their positions:
- King on g1
- Rook on g7
- Knight on h5
- Bishop on c4
- Bishop on a1
- Pawns on c5, a3, g2, and h2

Next, I will examine each piece to determine their legal moves.

1. **King on g1**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to f1, f2, h1, or h2. I need to ensure these moves do not place the King in check, but since I'm not considering Black's moves or threats at this stage (as per instructions), I will list these as potential moves. Visually inspecting the board, there are no immediate threats from Black's pieces to these squares that I can see without deeper calculation (e.g., Black's knight on d1 could potentially move, but I won't analyze that). So, possible moves: Kf1, Kf2, Kh1, Kh2.

2. **Rook on g7**: The Rook can move along the g-file or the 7th rank. On the g-file, it can move to g8 (attacking the Black rook on f8 indirectly, but it's defended by the Black king on h8), g6, g5, g4, g3, or g2 (but g2 is occupied by a White pawn, so not possible). On the 7th rank, it can move to h7, f7, e7, d7, c7, b7, or a7 (but a7 is occupied by a Black pawn, so up to b7). Checking the board, there are no pieces blocking these paths except as noted. So, possible moves: Rg8, Rg6, Rg5, Rg4, Rg3, Rh7, Rf7, Re7, Rd7, Rc7, Rb7.

3. **Knight on h5**: The Knight moves in an L-shape. From h5, possible squares are f6, f4, g3, and g7 (but g7 is occupied by the White rook, so not possible). Checking the board, f6 is occupied by a Black pawn, but capturing is allowed, so Nh5xf6 is possible. f4 and g3 are empty. So, possible moves: Nxf6, Nf4, Ng3.

4. **Bishop on c4**: The Bishop moves diagonally. From c4, it can move along the a2-g8 diagonal to b3, a2, d5, e6, f7, or g8 (but g8 is occupied by a Black rook, so capturing is possible). It can also move along the h1-a8 diagonal to b5, a6, d3, e2, or f1. Checking the board, no White pieces block these paths, and e6 is empty, f7 is empty, g8 has a Black rook. So, possible moves: Bb3, Ba2, Bd5, Be6, Bf7, Bxg8, Bb5, Ba6, Bd3, Be2, Bf1.

5. **Bishop on a1**: The Bishop on a1 can move along the a1-h8 diagonal to b2, c3, d4, e5, f6 (but f6 is occupied by a Black pawn, so capturing is possible), g7 (occupied by White rook, so not possible), or h8 (occupied by Black king, but can't capture king). So, possible moves: Bb2, Bc3, Bd4, Be5, Bxf6.

6. **Pawn on c5**: The pawn can move forward to c6 since it's empty. It cannot capture anything as there are no Black pieces on b6 or d6. So, possible move: c6.

7. **Pawn on a3**: The pawn can move forward to a4 since it's empty. It cannot capture anything as there are no Black pieces on b4. So, possible move: a4.

8. **Pawn on g2**: The pawn can move forward to g3 or g4 (since it hasn't moved yet, it can move two squares). Both squares are empty. It cannot capture anything as there are no Black pieces on f3 or h3. So, possible moves: g3, g4.

9. **Pawn on h2**: The pawn can move forward to h3 or h4. Both squares are empty. It cannot capture anything as there are no Black pieces on g3. So, possible moves: h3, h4.

Summarizing, White has numerous legal moves available, including moves with the King, Rook, Knight, Bishops, and Pawns. Since the task is to find one legal move, I can select any of these. I will choose a simple and straightforward move to avoid any complexity or potential oversight. Moving the pawn on c5 to c6 seems like a reasonable choice as it advances a central pawn and potentially strengthens White's position without immediate risk (since I'm not analyzing Black's response).

Thus, the move I will select is c6.
