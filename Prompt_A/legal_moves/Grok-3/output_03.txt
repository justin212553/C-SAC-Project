--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
Let's analyze the given position using the FEN: 6k1/5ppp/8/4R3/1K6/8/8/8 w - - 0 1. This describes a chessboard where White has a king on b4 and a rook on e5, while Black has a king on g8 and pawns on f7, g7, and h7. It is White's turn to move.

My task is to find one legal move for White. Since the goal is simply to identify a legal move and not necessarily the best move or a sequence leading to a specific outcome, I will focus on identifying all possible moves for White's pieces and select one.

First, let's consider the White king on b4. The king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) as long as the destination square is not occupied by a friendly piece or under attack. Since there are no Black pieces threatening nearby squares (Black's king is far away on g8 and the pawns are not in a position to attack immediately), the White king can move to any adjacent square. The possible moves for the king are:
- a3, a4, a5 (diagonal and vertical moves to the a-file)
- b3, b5 (vertical moves)
- c3, c4, c5 (diagonal and vertical moves to the c-file)

That's a total of 8 possible moves for the king.

Next, let's look at the White rook on e5. The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, as long as the path is not blocked by other pieces. Checking the board:
- Horizontally on the 5th rank: the rook can move to any square from a5 to h5, since there are no pieces on this rank.
- Vertically on the e-file: the rook can move up to e6, e7, or e8 (since e8 is empty), or down to e4, e3, e2, or e1 (all empty).

So, the rook's possible moves are:
- Horizontal: a5, b5, c5, d5, f5, g5, h5 (7 squares, since e5 is its current position)
- Vertical: e1, e2, e3, e4, e6, e7, e8 (7 squares)

That's a total of 14 possible moves for the rook.

Combining both pieces, White has a total of 8 (king) + 14 (rook) = 22 legal moves in this position. Since the instruction is to provide just one legal move, I will choose a simple and straightforward move. Let's move the rook to e6, as it advances the rook slightly and keeps it centralized, which is generally a good principle in chess, though not critical for this specific task.

I will now output this move in PGN format as requested.
