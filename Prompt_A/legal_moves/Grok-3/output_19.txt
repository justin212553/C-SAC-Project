--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **1K1R4/1PP2PPP/8/P4p2/pN1Q2p1/1pNp1q1p/1kp1r3/2r5 w - - 0 1**. This represents the current state of the chessboard, and since the 'w' in the FEN indicates it is White's turn to move, my task is to find one legal move for White.

First, I decode the FEN to visualize the board:
- 8th rank: 1K1R4 → empty, White King, empty, White Rook, empty x4
- 7th rank: 1PP2PPP → empty, White Pawn, White Pawn, empty x2, White Pawn, White Pawn, White Pawn
- 6th rank: 8 → empty x8
- 5th rank: P4p2 → White Pawn, empty x4, Black Pawn, empty x2
- 4th rank: pN1Q2p1 → Black Pawn, White Knight, empty, White Queen, empty x2, Black Pawn, empty
- 3rd rank: 1pNp1q1p → empty, Black Pawn, White Knight, Black Pawn, empty, Black Queen, empty, Black Pawn
- 2nd rank: 1kp1r3 → empty, Black King, Black Pawn, empty, Black Rook, empty x3
- 1st rank: 2r5 → empty x2, Black Rook, empty x5

White's pieces are:
- King on b8
- Rook on d8
- Queen on d4
- Knights on b4 and c3
- Pawns on a5, b7, c7, d3, f7, g7, h7

Black's pieces are:
- King on b2
- Rooks on c1 and e2
- Queen on f3
- Pawns on a4, b3, c2, f5, g4, h3

Since it's White's turn, I need to identify all movable White pieces and determine legal moves for them. I will systematically check each piece.

1. **White King on b8**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are a8, a7, b7, c7, c8. However:
   - a8 is empty, but I need to check if moving there is legal (i.e., not into check).
   - a7 is empty.
   - b7 is occupied by a White Pawn, so it's blocked.
   - c7 is occupied by a White Pawn, so it's blocked.
   - c8 is empty.
   I will temporarily consider Ka8, Ka7, or Kc8 as potential moves, but I must ensure the King isn't moving into check. For now, I note these as possible moves and will verify later if needed.

2. **White Rook on d8**: The Rook can move horizontally or vertically. Checking the d-file and 8th rank:
   - d-file: d7, d6, d5, d4 are empty until d4 (occupied by White Queen, so blocked).
   - 8th rank: e8, f8, g8, h8 are empty; a8, b8, c8 are empty until b8 (White King), but since the King is on b8, moving left is blocked at c8.
   Possible moves: Rd7, Rd6, Rd5, Re8, Rf8, Rg8, Rh8.

3. **White Queen on d4**: The Queen can move like a Rook or Bishop. Checking files, ranks, and diagonals:
   - d-file: d5, d6, d7, d8 (d8 is White Rook, so up to d7); d3 is White Pawn, so blocked downward.
   - 4th rank: e4, f4, g4 (g4 is Black Pawn, can capture); c4, b4 (b4 is White Knight, blocked).
   - Diagonals: e5, f6, g7 (g7 is White Pawn, blocked); c5, b6, a7; e3, f2, g1; c3 (White Knight, blocked).
   Possible moves include Qd5, Qd6, Qd7, Qe4, Qf4, Qxg4, Qc5, Qb6, Qa7, Qe3, Qf2, Qg1.

4. **White Knight on b4**: Knights move in an L-shape. Possible squares from b4 are a6, c6, d5, d3 (occupied by White Pawn, blocked), c2 (Black Pawn, can capture), a2.
   Possible moves: Na6, Nc6, Nd5, Nxc2.

5. **White Knight on c3**: Possible squares from c3 are a4 (Black Pawn, can capture), b5, d5, e4, e2 (Black Rook, can capture), d1, b1, a2.
   Possible moves: Nxa4, Nb5, Nd5, Ne4, Nxe2, Nd1, Nb1, Na2.

6. **White Pawns**:
   - a5: Can move to a6 (empty); a7 is empty but two squares only from initial position, so only a6.
   - b7: Can move to b8, but b8 is occupied by White King, so blocked.
   - c7: Can move to c8 (empty).
   - d3: Can move to d4, but d4 is occupied by White Queen, so blocked.
   - f7: Can move to f8 (empty).
   - g7: Can move to g8 (empty).
   - h7: Can move to h8 (empty).
   Possible pawn moves: a6, c8, f8, g8, h8.

At this point, I have identified several possible moves for White's pieces. Since the task is to find one legal move, I don't need to evaluate the best move or check for check conditions unless necessary. All moves listed are legal in terms of piece movement rules, though I must ensure the King isn't left in check after the move. However, since the problem simply asks for one legal move, I can select a straightforward move that doesn't involve complex verification.

I choose a simple pawn move, such as moving the pawn from a5 to a6, as it is a clear, unobstructed move with no immediate risk of illegality.

Thus, the move I select is a5 to a6.
