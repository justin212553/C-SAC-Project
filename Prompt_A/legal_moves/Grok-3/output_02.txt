--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
Let's analyze the given position using the provided FEN: **5k1K/5qn1/6b1/8/8/8/8/8 b - - 0 1**. This FEN describes a chess position where it is Black's turn to move. First, I will break down the position to understand the placement of the pieces:

- The board has the following pieces:
  - Black king on f8
  - Black queen on f7
  - Black knight on g7
  - Black bishop on g6
  - White king on h8

My task is to find one legal move for Black. Since the goal is simply to identify a legal move and not necessarily the best move or a sequence leading to a specific outcome, I will focus on identifying any valid move for Black's pieces. I will not consider White's potential responses or future moves, as per the instructions.

Let's examine each of Black's pieces and their possible moves:

1. **Black King on f8**:
   - The king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) as long as the destination square is not occupied by a friendly piece or under attack. Since I am not considering White's moves or threats (as per the instruction to only consider my moves), I will simply check for legal destinations.
   - Possible moves: e8, e7, f7, g8, g7.
   - However, f7 is occupied by the Black queen, and g7 is occupied by the Black knight. Thus, the king cannot move to f7 or g7.
   - Legal moves for the king: e8, e7, g8.

2. **Black Queen on f7**:
   - The queen can move any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) until it reaches an occupied square or the edge of the board.
   - Horizontal moves (along rank 7): to a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, g7, h7.
   - g7 is occupied by the Black knight, so the queen cannot move there or beyond.
   - Vertical moves (along file f): to f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f8.
   - f8 is occupied by the Black king, so the queen cannot move there or beyond.
   - Diagonal moves:
     - Northeast (towards h8): f7 to g8 or h8, but h8 is occupied by the White king, so it can move to g8 or capture on h8.
     - Northwest (towards a2): f7 to e8, or continue to d9 (off-board, so stop at e8).
     - Southeast (towards h5): f7 to g6, but g6 is occupied by the Black bishop, so it cannot move there or beyond.
     - Southwest (towards a4): f7 to e6, d5, c4, b3, a2.
   - Legal moves include a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, h7, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, e8, g8, h8 (capture), e6, d5, c4, b3, a2, and others.

3. **Black Knight on g7**:
   - The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one perpendicular, or vice versa.
   - Possible moves from g7: e8, e6, f5, h5.
   - All these squares are empty, so all are legal moves.

4. **Black Bishop on g6**:
   - The bishop moves diagonally any number of squares until it reaches an occupied square or the edge of the board.
   - Diagonal moves:
     - Northeast (towards h7): g6 to h7.
     - Northwest (towards f7): g6 to f7, but f7 is occupied by the Black queen, so it cannot move there or beyond.
     - Southeast (towards h5): g6 to h5, then continue to g4, f3, e2, d1.
     - Southwest (towards f5): g6 to f5, e4, d3, c2, b1.
   - Legal moves include h7, h5, g4, f3, e2, d1, f5, e4, d3, c2, b1.

From this analysis, Black has numerous legal moves available with the king, queen, knight, and bishop. Since the task is to provide just one legal move, I will select a simple and straightforward move. Let's choose a move for the Black king from f8 to e8, as it is a basic move and does not involve any captures or complex considerations.

I will now output the move in PGN format, ensuring proper notation. Since the FEN indicates it is Black's turn and no move number is specified in the FEN, I will assume it is move 1 for consistency in the output (though in real games, move numbers depend on the game context). In PGN, Black's move is denoted after the move number with "...", indicating it is Black's turn.
