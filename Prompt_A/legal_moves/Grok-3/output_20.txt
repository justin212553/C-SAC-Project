--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **2R5/1KP1R3/1PnP1Q1P/Pn1q2P1/p4P2/8/1pp2ppp/1k1r4 b - - 0 1**. This indicates it is Black's turn to move. My task is to find one legal move for Black, focusing solely on Black's pieces and their possible moves without considering White's responses or future moves.

First, I decode the FEN to understand the board layout:
- 8th rank: 2 empty squares, Rook (White), 5 empty squares.
- 7th rank: 1 empty square, King (White), Pawn (White), 1 empty square, Rook (White), 3 empty squares.
- 6th rank: 1 empty square, Pawn (White), Knight (Black), Pawn (White), 1 empty square, Queen (White), 1 empty square, Pawn (White).
- 5th rank: Pawn (White), Knight (Black), 1 empty square, Queen (Black), 2 empty squares, Pawn (White), 1 empty square.
- 4th rank: Pawn (Black), 4 empty squares, Pawn (White), 2 empty squares.
- 3rd rank: 8 empty squares.
- 2nd rank: 1 empty square, Pawn (Black), Pawn (Black), 2 empty squares, Pawn (Black), Pawn (Black), Pawn (Black).
- 1st rank: 1 empty square, King (Black), 1 empty square, Rook (Black), 4 empty squares.

Black's pieces are:
- King on b1.
- Queen on d5.
- Rook on d1.
- Knight on b5.
- Knight on c6.
- Pawns on a4, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2.

I now systematically check each of Black's pieces for legal moves.

1. **King on b1**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are a1, a2, b2, c2, c1. However:
   - a1 is empty, but I need to ensure it's not under attack (though the problem doesn't require checking for check, just a legal move).
   - a2 is empty.
   - b2 is occupied by a Black pawn, so not possible.
   - c2 is occupied by a Black pawn, so not possible.
   - c1 is empty.
   So, possible moves are Ka1, Ka2, Kc1. I will consider Ka2 as a candidate move.

2. **Queen on d5**: The Queen can move any number of squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). Checking possible moves:
   - Vertically up: d6 (occupied by White pawn), so blocked.
   - Vertically down: d4 (empty), d3 (empty), d2 (empty), d1 (occupied by Black Rook), so possible moves are Qd4, Qd3, Qd2.
   - Horizontally left: c5 (empty), b5 (occupied by Black Knight), so possible move is Qc5.
   - Horizontally right: e5 (empty), f5 (occupied by White pawn), so possible move is Qe5.
   - Diagonally up-left: c6 (occupied by Black Knight), so blocked.
   - Diagonally up-right: e6 (occupied by White Queen), so blocked.
   - Diagonally down-left: c4 (empty), b3 (empty), a2 (empty), so possible moves are Qc4, Qb3, Qa2.
   - Diagonally down-right: e4 (empty), f3 (empty), g2 (occupied by Black pawn), so possible moves are Qe4, Qf3.
   So, many possible moves for the Queen, such as Qd4 or Qc5. I will keep Qd4 as a candidate.

3. **Rook on d1**: The Rook can move vertically or horizontally.
   - Vertically up: d2 (empty), d3 (empty), d4 (empty), d5 (occupied by Black Queen), so possible moves are Rd2, Rd3, Rd4.
   - Horizontally left: c1 (empty), b1 (occupied by Black King), so possible move is Rc1.
   - Horizontally right: e1 (empty), f1 (empty), g1 (empty), h1 (empty), so possible moves are Re1, Rf1, Rg1, Rh1.
   So, possible moves include Rd2 or Rc1. I will consider Rd2 as a candidate.

4. **Knight on b5**: The Knight moves in an L-shape. Possible squares from b5 are a7, c7, d6, d4, c3, a3.
   - a7 is empty.
   - c7 is occupied by White pawn, so possible capture Nxc7.
   - d6 is occupied by White pawn, so possible capture Nxd6.
   - d4 is empty.
   - c3 is empty.
   - a3 is empty.
   So, possible moves are Na7, Nxc7, Nxd6, Nd4, Nc3, Na3. I will consider Nxc7 as a candidate.

5. **Knight on c6**: Possible squares from c6 are a5, b8, d8, e7, e5, d4, b4, a7.
   - a5 is occupied by White pawn, so possible capture Nxa5.
   - b8 is empty.
   - d8 is empty.
   - e7 is occupied by White Rook, so possible capture Nxe7.
   - e5 is empty.
   - d4 is empty.
   - b4 is empty.
   - a7 is empty.
   So, possible moves include Nxa5, Nb8, Nd8, Nxe7, Ne5, Nd4, Nb4, Na7. I will consider Nxe7 as a candidate.

6. **Pawns**:
   - Pawn on a4: Can move to a3 (empty), or capture on b3 if there’s a White piece (there isn’t), so possible move is a3.
   - Pawn on b2: Can move to b1, but b1 is occupied by Black King, so no move.
   - Pawn on c2: Can move to c1 (empty), so possible move is c1 (and it would promote since it’s the 1st rank).
   - Pawn on f2: Can move to f1 (empty), so possible move is f1 (promotion).
   - Pawn on g2: Can move to g1 (empty), so possible move is g1 (promotion).
   - Pawn on h2: Can move to h1 (empty), so possible move is h1 (promotion).
   For pawns on c2, f2, g2, h2, since they are on the 2nd rank moving to the 1st rank, they must promote to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight. I will consider c1=Q as a candidate.

There are many legal moves available for Black. Since the task is to find just one legal move, I will select a simple and straightforward move. Moving the Queen to d4 (Qd4) seems like a safe and centralizing move, without immediate risk or complexity.

Thus, my chosen move is Qd4.
