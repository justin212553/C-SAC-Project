--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
Let's analyze the given position using the FEN: 5r2/2R2P1k/7p/4q3/7K/8/6Q1/8 w - - 0 1. This describes the current state of the board, with White to move. My task is to find one legal move for White in this position, without considering the opponent's subsequent moves.

First, I will decode the FEN to understand the placement of the pieces:
- 8th rank: 5 empty squares, then a black rook (r), then 2 empty squares.
- 7th rank: 2 empty squares, then a white rook (R), 2 empty squares, a white pawn (P), a black king (k).
- 6th rank: 7 empty squares, then a black pawn (p).
- 5th rank: 4 empty squares, then a black queen (q), then 3 empty squares.
- 4th rank: 7 empty squares, then a white king (K).
- 3rd rank: 8 empty squares.
- 2nd rank: 6 empty squares, then a white queen (Q), then 1 empty square.
- 1st rank: 8 empty squares.

So, the pieces are:
- White: King on h4, Queen on g2, Rook on c7, Pawn on f7.
- Black: King on h7, Queen on e5, Rook on f8, Pawn on h6.

Since it's White's turn, I need to identify all possible legal moves for White's pieces.

1. **White King on h4**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to g3, g4, g5, h3, or h5. All these squares are currently unoccupied, so these are legal moves. I will not consider if moving the King exposes it to check for now, as the instruction is to focus only on my moves.

2. **White Queen on g2**: The Queen can move any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Let's check the possible moves:
   - Vertically up: g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, g8 (all empty).
   - Vertically down: g1 (empty).
   - Horizontally left: f2, e2, d2, c2, b2, a2 (all empty).
   - Horizontally right: h2 (empty).
   - Diagonally up-right: h3 (empty).
   - Diagonally up-left: f3, e4, d5, c6, b7, a8 (all empty).
   - Diagonally down-right: h1 (empty).
   - Diagonally down-left: f1, e1, d1, c1, b1, a1 (all empty).
   All these moves are legal as none of the destination squares are occupied by White's pieces.

3. **White Rook on c7**: The Rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
   - Vertically up: c8 (empty).
   - Vertically down: c6, c5, c4, c3, c2, c1 (all empty).
   - Horizontally left: b7, a7 (all empty).
   - Horizontally right: d7, e7 (empty), but f7 is occupied by White's own pawn, so it cannot move to or beyond f7.
   Legal moves are to c8, c6, c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, b7, a7, d7, e7.

4. **White Pawn on f7**: The Pawn can move forward one square if the square is empty, or capture diagonally if an opponent's piece is present. Since it's on f7, moving forward would be to f8 (empty), so it can promote to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight upon reaching the 8th rank. For captures:
   - Diagonally left: e8 (empty, no capture possible).
   - Diagonally right: g8 (empty, no capture possible).
   So, the only legal move is f7 to f8 with promotion (e.g., f8=Q).

I have identified multiple legal moves for White's pieces. Since the task is to provide just one legal move, I will choose a simple and straightforward one. Let's go with moving the White King from h4 to h5, as it is a basic move and does not involve complex decisions like promotion or potential checks (though I'm not analyzing checks as per instructions).

Thus, the move will be Kh5.
