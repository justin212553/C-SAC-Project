--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
Let's analyze the given chess position using the provided FEN: **5rkr/5ppp/8/8/4N1R1/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1**. This FEN describes the board setup, and since the 'w' indicates it's White's turn to move, I will focus on identifying a legal move for White.

First, let's break down the position:
- White pieces: King on g2, Knight on e4, Rook on g4.
- Black pieces: King on h8, Rook on f8, pawns on f7, g7, and h7.
- No en passant target, no castling rights for either side, and it's White's move.

Now, I will list all the movable pieces for White and consider their possible legal moves:
1. **King on g2**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to f1, f2, f3, g1, g3, h1, h2, h3. All these squares are currently unoccupied, so all are legal moves.
2. **Knight on e4**: The Knight moves in an L-shape. From e4, possible moves are to d2, d6, f2, f6, g3, g5, c3, c5. All these squares are unoccupied, so all are legal moves.
3. **Rook on g4**: The Rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. Vertically, it can move to g1, g2, g3, g5, g6, g7, g8. Horizontally, it can move to a4, b4, c4, d4, e4, f4, h4. However, e4 is occupied by the White Knight, so the Rook cannot move to or beyond e4 on the 4th rank. Thus, legal moves are g1, g2, g3, g5, g6, g7, g8, h4, f4, d4, c4, b4, a4.

Since the goal is to find one legal move, I can select any of these options. For simplicity, I will choose a straightforward move that doesn't require complex calculation. Let's go with moving the King from g2 to g3, as it is a safe and simple move with no immediate risk (noting that I am not considering Black's response as per the instructions).

Therefore, the move I will select is King from g2 to g3, notated in PGN as Kg3.
