--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: 6k1/2R5/4p1pp/8/5PPK/P3Q2P/1q4r1/8 b - - 0 1. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup and identify all possible legal moves for Black.

- **King**: Black's king is on g8.
- **Queen**: Black's queen is on b2.
- **Rook**: Black's rook is on g2.
- **Pawns**: Black has pawns on e6, g6, and h6.

Since it's Black's turn, I will consider all possible moves for these pieces without evaluating the opponent's potential responses or the overall game strategy, as the task is simply to find one legal move.

1. **King moves**: The king on g8 can potentially move to adjacent squares if they are not under attack or occupied by Black's own pieces. Possible squares are f8, f7, g7, h8, and h7. I need to check if these squares are safe, but since the task doesn't require evaluating threats, I can assume any unoccupied square is a potential move for now.
   - f8: empty, possible.
   - f7: empty, possible.
   - g7: empty, possible.
   - h8: empty, possible.
   - h7: empty, possible.

2. **Queen moves**: The queen on b2 can move along the b-file, the 2nd rank, or diagonally. Let's identify some possible squares:
   - Along the b-file: b1, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8.
   - Along the 2nd rank: a2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2 (but g2 is occupied by Black's rook, so not possible), h2.
   - Diagonally: for example, a1, c1, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8 (and other diagonals).
   - All these squares need to be checked for occupancy, but since the task is to find one legal move, I can pick any empty square or a square with a White piece for a capture.

3. **Rook moves**: The rook on g2 can move along the g-file or the 2nd rank.
   - Along the g-file: g1, g3, g4, g5, g6 (but g6 has a Black pawn, so up to g5).
   - Along the 2nd rank: a2, b2 (but b2 has Black's queen, so not possible beyond), c2, d2, e2, f2, h2.
   - Again, I can choose any empty square or a square with a White piece.

4. **Pawn moves**: 
   - Pawn on e6: can move to e5 if empty.
   - Pawn on g6: can move to g5 if empty.
   - Pawn on h6: can move to h5 if empty.
   - I need to check if these squares are occupied, but for simplicity, I can test one.

Looking at the FEN, I see the board visually:
- 8th rank: Black king on g8.
- 7th rank: White rook on c7.
- 6th rank: Black pawns on e6, g6, h6.
- 5th rank: empty.
- 4th rank: White pawns on f4, g4, White king on h4.
- 3rd rank: White pawn on a3, White queen on e3, White pawn on h3.
- 2nd rank: Black queen on b2, Black rook on g2.
- 1st rank: empty.

Now, confirming some moves:
- Black king can move to f8, f7, g7, h8, h7 (all empty).
- Black queen on b2 can move to b1, b3, b4, etc., or capture on a3 (White pawn).
- Black rook on g2 can move to g1, g3, g4, g5, or along the 2nd rank to f2, e2, d2, c2, etc.
- Black pawn on e6 can move to e5 (empty).
- Black pawn on g6 can move to g5 (empty, as White pawn is on g4).
- Black pawn on h6 can move to h5 (empty).

Since the task is to find just one legal move, I will choose a simple and straightforward move. Let's go with moving the Black pawn from e6 to e5, as it's a basic pawn push and clearly legal since e5 is empty.

I should also consider if any move delivers check or has special notation, but since the task doesn't require the best move, just a legal one, e6 to e5 is fine. Let me double-check the move in PGN format. Since it's Black's turn, and assuming the move number is based on the FEN (though not specified), I will denote it appropriately.

The FEN shows "0 1", which might imply move 1, but since it's Black to move, it could be the second half of a move. In PGN, I need to ensure the move number is correct. Since the problem doesn't specify the move number, I will assume it's move 1 for Black for simplicity, though typically PGN includes the full move number.

Looking at the instructions, it says "add white and black move numbers appropriately," but since only one move is needed, and it's Black's turn, I will write it as "...1...e5" to indicate Black's move.

I think the simplest is to output just the move with the number as per standard PGN for Black's turn.
