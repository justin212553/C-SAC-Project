--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: r5k1/2R3pp/5p2/1p2p3/2b1p3/6P1/5P1P/6KN b - - 0 1. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup and identify all possible legal moves for Black.

First, I note the placement of Black's pieces:
- King on g8
- Rook on a8
- Bishop on c4
- Pawns on b5, e5, e4, f6, g7, and h7

Next, I consider the placement of White's pieces to understand the constraints:
- King on h1
- Knight on g1
- Rook on c7
- Pawns on f2, g3, and h2

Since it's Black's turn, I will systematically check each of Black's pieces for legal moves, ensuring they adhere to chess rules and do not leave the king in check (though in this case, I will focus on generating moves without deep evaluation of future positions as per the instruction to only consider my moves).

1. **King on g8**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are f8, f7, g7, and h8 (h7 is occupied by a Black pawn, and other adjacent squares are either off the board or not directly adjacent). I check if these moves are legal:
   - f8: No White piece attacks this square directly (White's rook on c7 controls the 7th rank but not f8; knight on g1 and king on h1 are not in range). This is a legal move.
   - f7: Similarly, no direct attack; legal move.
   - g7: Occupied by Black's pawn, so illegal.
   - h8: No direct attack; legal move.
   So, possible king moves are Kg8-f8, Kg8-f7, Kg8-h8.

2. **Rook on a8**: The rook can move along the a-file or the 8th rank. Checking possible moves:
   - Along a-file: a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1 are all empty and not blocked; all are legal.
   - Along 8th rank: b8, c8, d8, e8, f8 are empty until g8 (king), so b8 to f8 are legal.
   So, possible rook moves are Ra8 to a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8.

3. **Bishop on c4**: The bishop moves diagonally. Checking the diagonals:
   - Northwest: b5 is occupied by Black's pawn, so blocked.
   - Northeast: d5, e6, f7, g8 (king) are empty until g8, but g8 is occupied by own king, so d5, e6, f7 are legal.
   - Southeast: d3, e2, f1, g2, h3 are empty or off-board, but no blocks until edge, so d3, e2, f1 are legal (g2 and h3 are off or not directly relevant).
   - Southwest: b3, a2 are empty, so legal.
   So, possible bishop moves are Bc4 to d5, e6, f7, d3, e2, f1, b3, a2.

4. **Pawns**:
   - Pawn on b5: Can move to b4 (single move forward, empty square). No capture possible (no White piece on a4 or c4). Legal move: b5-b4.
   - Pawn on e5: Can move to e6 (but e6 is empty, wait no: e5 pawn moves forward to e4, but e4 is occupied by another Black pawn, so blocked. Pawn on e5 cannot move forward as e4 is occupied by own piece. No captures (no White pieces on d4 or f4). So, no legal move for e5 pawn.
   - Pawn on e4: Moves forward to e3 (empty square). No captures (no White pieces on d3 or f3). Legal move: e4-e3.
   - Pawn on f6: Moves forward to f5 (empty square). No captures (no White pieces on e5 or g5). Legal move: f6-f5.
   - Pawn on g7: Moves forward to g6 (empty square) or g5 (two squares, since it's on 7th rank, and g6 and g5 are empty). No captures. Legal moves: g7-g6, g7-g5.
   - Pawn on h7: Moves forward to h6 (empty) or h5 (two squares, since on 7th rank, and h6, h5 empty). No captures. Legal moves: h7-h6, h7-h5.

Summarizing, Black has numerous legal moves:
- King: Kf8, Kf7, Kh8
- Rook: Ra7, Ra6, Ra5, Ra4, Ra3, Ra2, Ra1, Rb8, Rc8, Rd8, Re8, Rf8
- Bishop: Bd5, Be6, Bf7, Bd3, Be2, Bf1, Bb3, Ba2
- Pawns: b5-b4, e4-e3, f6-f5, g7-g6, g7-g5, h7-h6, h7-h5

The goal is to find one legal move. Since the instruction is straightforward and does not require the best move or any specific strategy beyond legality, I can select any of these moves. For simplicity, I will choose a straightforward pawn move, such as advancing the pawn from h7 to h6, as it is a basic and safe move without immediate tactical implications to consider (as per the instruction to not consider opponent's moves).

I confirm the move is legal: h7 to h6 is empty, it's a standard pawn move forward one square, and no rules are violated.

Thus, the move I select is h7 to h6.
