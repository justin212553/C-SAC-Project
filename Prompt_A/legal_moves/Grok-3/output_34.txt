--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: r3N2k/R4R2/2p3pp/4p3/3n2bb/1P1P4/2r2R2/BN2K3 b - - 0 1. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. My task is to find one legal move for Black, focusing solely on Black's pieces and their possible moves without considering White's responses or future moves.

First, I decode the FEN to understand the board setup:
- 8th rank: r (Black rook), 3 empty squares, N (White knight), 2 empty squares, k (Black king)
- 7th rank: R (White rook), 4 empty squares, R (White rook), 2 empty squares
- 6th rank: 2 empty squares, p (Black pawn), 3 empty squares, p (Black pawn), p (Black pawn)
- 5th rank: 4 empty squares, p (Black pawn), 3 empty squares
- 4th rank: 3 empty squares, n (Black knight), 2 empty squares, b (Black bishop), b (Black bishop)
- 3rd rank: 1 empty square, P (White pawn), 1 empty square, P (White pawn), 4 empty squares
- 2nd rank: 2 empty squares, r (Black rook), 2 empty squares, R (White rook), 2 empty squares
- 1st rank: B (White bishop), N (White knight), 2 empty squares, K (White king), 3 empty squares

Now, I list Black's pieces and their positions:
- King on h8
- Rook on a8
- Rook on c2
- Knight on d4
- Bishop on g4
- Bishop on h4
- Pawns on c6, g6, h6, and e5

Next, I evaluate possible moves for each of Black's pieces:
1. **King on h8**: Possible moves are to g8 or g7 (since h7 is empty as per FEN interpretation). I need to ensure the king isn't moving into check, but since the task is to find one legal move and not to analyze threats, I can consider g8 or g7 as potential moves for now.
2. **Rook on a8**: It can move along the a-file (a7 to a1) or along the 8th rank (b8 to h8, but h8 is occupied by the king). Since a7 is occupied by a White rook, moves down the a-file are blocked after a7 (capture possible). Moves along the 8th rank are possible to b8, c8, d8, but e8 has a White knight, so up to d8. I can consider moving to b8 as a simple option.
3. **Rook on c2**: It can move along the c-file or 2nd rank. On the c-file, c3 to c8 are possible (c6 has a Black pawn, so up to c5 if not capturing own piece). On the 2nd rank, b2 and a2 are empty, d2 to h2 are possible but f2 has a White rook, so up to e2. Moving to b2 is a straightforward option.
4. **Knight on d4**: Possible knight moves are to b5, b3, c6 (occupied by Black pawn, so invalid), c2 (occupied by Black rook, invalid), e6, e2, f5, f3. So, valid moves include b5, b3, e6, e2, f5, f3.
5. **Bishop on g4**: Moves along diagonals. From g4, possible squares are h5 (empty), f5 (empty), e6 (empty), d7 (empty), c8 (empty), h3 (empty), f3 (empty), e2 (empty but White rook on f2 might be capturable if on path, but direct diagonal), etc. Many options are available.
6. **Bishop on h4**: Moves along diagonals to g5, f6, e7, d8, or g3, f2 (White rook, capturable), e1, etc. Capturing on f2 is a notable option.
7. **Pawn on c6**: Can move to c5 (empty) or capture if something is on b5 or d5 (nothing there, so only c5).
8. **Pawn on g6**: Can move to g5 (empty) or capture on f5 or h5 (nothing there, so only g5).
9. **Pawn on h6**: Can move to h5 (empty) or capture on g5 (nothing there, so only h5).
10. **Pawn on e5**: Can move to e4 (empty) or capture on d4 or f4 (d4 has Black knight, so invalid; f4 empty, so only e4).

Since the goal is to find one legal move, I can select a simple, non-committal move that doesn't require deep analysis of captures or checks. Moving the rook from a8 to b8 seems like a safe and straightforward choice. It doesn't capture anything, doesn't move into an obviously threatened square (without analyzing White's moves), and is a clear legal move.

I will confirm the move notation. The rook on a8 moving to b8: since there is another Black rook on c2, I need to disambiguate if necessary, but in standard PGN, if no ambiguity in destination, it's fine. However, to be precise, it's Rab8 (rook from a-file to b8).

In PGN, it's usually written as Rab8 if disambiguation is needed, but since no other rook can move to b8, Rb8 should suffice. I will stick with Rb8 for simplicity.

Thus, my chosen move for Black is Rb8.
