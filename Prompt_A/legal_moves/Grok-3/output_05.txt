--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: 8/7R/k7/2P5/1PP3B1/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1. This represents a chessboard with White to move. Let's break down the position to understand the pieces and their locations.

- White pieces:
  - King on a1
  - Rook on h7
  - Bishop on g4
  - Pawns on b4, c4, and c5
- Black piece:
  - King on a6

Since it's White's turn, I need to identify all legal moves for White's pieces. I will consider each piece one by one, focusing only on White's possible moves for this turn, as instructed.

1. **White King on a1**: The King can move one square in any direction. Possible moves are to b1, b2, or a2. There are no enemy pieces threatening these squares, and moving the King does not seem to be under any immediate restriction (like castling, which isn't possible here due to the position and FEN indicating no castling rights). So, legal moves are:
   - Ka1-b1
   - Ka1-a2
   - Ka1-b2

2. **White Rook on h7**: The Rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. From h7, it can move along the h-file to h1 through h6 or h8, or along the 7th rank to a7 through g7. Checking for obstructions, there are no pieces on the h-file or the 7th rank blocking its path. However, moving to a7 would place it on a square adjacent to the Black King on a6, which is legal as Rooks can move to squares next to enemy Kings (it would be check). So, legal moves are:
   - Rh7-h1, Rh7-h2, Rh7-h3, Rh7-h4, Rh7-h5, Rh7-h6, Rh7-h8
   - Rh7-g7, Rh7-f7, Rh7-e7, Rh7-d7, Rh7-c7, Rh7-b7, Rh7-a7
   Moving to a7 would be check since the Rook would be on a square from which it attacks the Black King (same rank, adjacent file).

3. **White Bishop on g4**: The Bishop can move diagonally any number of squares. From g4, it can move to h5, f3, e2, d1 (northeast and southwest diagonals) or to h3, f5 (southeast and northwest diagonals). Checking the diagonals, there are no pieces obstructing these paths. So, legal moves are:
   - Bg4-h5, Bg4-f5
   - Bg4-h3, Bg4-f3, Bg4-e2, Bg4-d1

4. **White Pawn on b4**: Pawns move forward one square (or two from their starting position, but b4 is not the starting rank). Since it's on b4, it can move to b5 if the square is empty, which it is. It cannot capture diagonally as there are no enemy pieces on a5 or c5. So, legal move:
   - b4-b5

5. **White Pawn on c4**: Similarly, this pawn can move to c5, but c5 is occupied by another White pawn, so this move is blocked. It cannot capture diagonally as there are no enemy pieces on b5 or d5. So, no legal moves for this pawn.

6. **White Pawn on c5**: This pawn can move to c6 if the square is empty, which it is. It cannot capture diagonally as there are no enemy pieces on b6 or d6. So, legal move:
   - c5-c6

Summarizing, White has multiple legal moves available:
- King: Ka1-b1, Ka1-a2, Ka1-b2
- Rook: Rh7 to h1-h6, h8, g7-f7-e7-d7-c7-b7-a7 (with Ra7 being check)
- Bishop: Bg4 to h5, f5, h3, f3, e2, d1
- Pawns: b4-b5, c5-c6

The goal is to find one legal move. Since the instruction is simply to provide one legal move, I can choose any of these. However, to make it meaningful, I’ll select a move that has some strategic value, such as putting the opponent in check. Moving the Rook to a7 (Rh7-a7) places the Black King in check, which is a strong move in this position.

I verify that Rh7-a7 is indeed legal: the path is clear (no pieces on the 7th rank between h7 and a7), and moving the Rook to a7 attacks the Black King on a6 (Rooks attack along ranks and files, so a7 directly threatens a6). This move should be notated as Ra7+ to indicate check.

Thus, I will select Rh7-a7 as the move to output.
