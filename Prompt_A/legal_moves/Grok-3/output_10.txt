--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I am analyzing the given chess position defined by the FEN: 8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2 b - - 0 1. This FEN indicates that it is Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup and identify all possible legal moves for Black.

First, I interpret the FEN string:
- The board is represented as 8/8/8/8/8/4pk2/5p2/5K2.
- Starting from the 8th rank to the 1st rank:
  - 8th to 5th ranks are empty (8/8/8/8).
  - 6th rank: 4 empty squares, then a black pawn (p), a black king (k), and 2 empty squares (4pk2).
  - 5th rank: 5 empty squares, a black pawn (p), and 2 empty squares (5p2).
  - 4th to 2nd ranks are empty as per the FEN, but since it's only up to 6th rank explicitly mentioned, the 1st rank must be interpreted.
  - Correction: FEN is read from 8th to 1st rank, so the last part "5K2" indicates the 1st rank with 5 empty squares, a white king (K), and 2 empty squares.
- So, pieces are:
  - Black king on f6 (6th rank, f-file).
  - Black pawn on e6 (6th rank, e-file).
  - Black pawn on f5 (5th rank, f-file).
  - White king on f1 (1st rank, f-file).
- It's Black to move, no castling rights, no en passant, move number not relevant for single move analysis.

Now, I identify all moveable pieces for Black:
1. Black king on f6.
2. Black pawn on e6.
3. Black pawn on f5.

I will consider legal moves for each piece:
- **Black King on f6**: The king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) as long as the destination square is not occupied by a friendly piece or under attack. Since we are only considering Black's moves without needing to account for White's responses or checks for this task (as per instructions), I focus on possible squares:
  - Possible squares: e7, f7, g7, e6 (occupied by own pawn, so invalid), g6, e5, f5 (occupied by own pawn, so invalid), g5.
  - Valid moves: Ke7, Kf7, Kg7, Kg6, Ke5, Kg5.
- **Black Pawn on e6**: Pawns move forward (towards the 1st rank for Black) one square, or two squares from the initial position (which is rank 7 for Black pawns, so not applicable here since it's on rank 6). No captures are possible as there are no White pieces diagonally adjacent.
  - Possible move: e5 (one square forward, since e5 is empty).
  - Valid move: e5.
- **Black Pawn on f5**: Similarly, this pawn can move forward one square.
  - Possible move: f4 (one square forward, since f4 is empty).
  - Valid move: f4.

Summarizing Black's legal moves:
- King moves: Ke7, Kf7, Kg7, Kg6, Ke5, Kg5.
- Pawn moves: e6 to e5, f5 to f4.

Since the goal is to find one legal move, I can select any of these. I will choose the simplest and most straightforward move for clarity. Moving the pawn from f5 to f4 is a basic pawn advance and does not involve any complex considerations.

Thus, the move I select is f5 to f4 for the black pawn.
