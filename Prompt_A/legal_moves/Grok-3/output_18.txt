--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3nP3/2QPqP2/PP3B1P/3R1R1K b - - 0 1**. This indicates it's Black's turn to move. My task is to find one legal move for Black, focusing solely on Black's pieces and their possible moves without considering White's responses.

First, I identify Black's pieces on the board:
- King on g8
- Rooks on d8 and f8
- Knight on d4
- Queen on e3
- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, f7, g7, and h7

Next, I evaluate the possible moves for each piece, ensuring they are legal according to chess rules (i.e., the king is not left in check after the move, and the move adheres to the piece's movement capabilities).

1. **King on g8**: The king can move one square in any direction. Possible squares are f8 (occupied by Black's rook, so illegal), h8, g7 (occupied by Black's pawn, so illegal), and h7 (occupied by Black's pawn, so illegal). The only legal move is to h8. I will check if this move leaves the king in check later, but for now, it's a candidate: Kg8-h8.

2. **Rook on d8**: The rook can move along the d-file or the 8th rank. On the d-file, it can move to d7, d6, d5, or d4 (d4 is occupied by Black's knight, so illegal). On the 8th rank, it can move to e8, c8, b8, or a8. All these squares are empty, so moves like Rd8-d7 or Rd8-e8 are legal candidates.

3. **Rook on f8**: The rook can move along the f-file or the 8th rank. On the f-file, it can move to f7 (occupied by Black's pawn, so illegal) or beyond, but f7 blocks further movement. On the 8th rank, it can move to e8, d8 (occupied by Black's rook, so illegal), g8 (occupied by Black's king, so illegal), or h8. So, a legal move is Rf8-e8.

4. **Knight on d4**: The knight moves in an L-shape. From d4, possible squares are e6, f5, f3, e2, c2, b3, b5, and c6. Checking the board, e6, f5, b5, and c6 are empty; f3 is occupied by White's pawn, e2 is empty, c2 is empty, and b3 is occupied by White's queen. Capturing on f3 or b3 is possible, as is moving to empty squares like e6. So, moves like Nd4-e6 or Nd4xf3 are legal.

5. **Queen on e3**: The queen can move like a rook or bishop. Along the e-file, it can move to e4, e5, e6, e7, or e8 (all empty except e4, which is occupied by White's pawn, so Qxe4 is a capture). Diagonally, it can move to d2, c1, f2, g1, d4 (occupied by Black's knight, so illegal), f4, g5, or h6. Most of these are empty or occupied by White's pieces (like f2, White's bishop). So, moves like Qe3-e4 (capture) or Qe3-f4 are legal.

6. **Pawns**:
   - a7 can move to a6 or a5 (both empty).
   - b7 can move to b6 or b5 (both empty).
   - c7 can move to c6 or c5 (both empty).
   - f7 can move to f6 or f5 (both empty).
   - g7 can move to g6 or g5 (both empty).
   - h7 can move to h6 or h5 (both empty).
   All pawn moves appear legal at first glance.

I must ensure that any move I choose does not leave Black's king in check. Since the FEN does not indicate the king is currently in check, I need to verify if moving a piece exposes the king to a discovered check or similar threat. However, a quick scan shows White's pieces (queen on b3, bishop on f2, rooks on d1 and f1, pawns on a2, b2, e4, f3, h2) do not immediately threaten g8 in a way that most moves would expose the king. For simplicity, I can choose a move that does not involve the king or critical defensive pieces until a deeper check is needed.

Among the many legal moves, I can select a simple, non-committal move to fulfill the requirement of finding one legal move. A pawn move like a7 to a6 is straightforward and unlikely to alter the position in a way that immediately puts the king in check, as no White piece directly attacks the a-file or is poised for a discovered attack via this move.

Thus, I will choose the move a7 to a6 for Black.
