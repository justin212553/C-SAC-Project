--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---
I begin by analyzing the given FEN position: **8/6q1/8/7k/4Q3/7P/2r2p1K/5R2 b - - 0 1**. This indicates that it is Black's turn to move. Let's break down the position to understand the board setup and identify all of Black's legal moves.

- **Black pieces**:
  - King on h5 (Kh5)
  - Queen on g7 (Qg7)
  - Rook on c2 (Rc2)
  - Pawn on f2 (pf2)
- **White pieces**:
  - King on h2 (Kh2)
  - Queen on e4 (Qe4)
  - Rook on f1 (Rf1)
  - Pawn on h3 (ph3)

Since it's Black's turn, I will focus on the possible moves for Black's pieces without considering White's responses or potential threats beyond identifying legal moves.

1. **Black King on h5**:
   - Possible squares: g6, g5, g4, h6, h4.
   - Check for legality:
     - g6: Not occupied, appears legal.
     - g5: Not occupied, appears legal.
     - g4: Not occupied, appears legal.
     - h6: Not occupied, appears legal.
     - h4: Not occupied, appears legal.
   - All these moves seem possible, but I must ensure the king isn't moving into check. For now, I'll assume they are legal as I don't see immediate threats from White's pieces without deeper calculation.

2. **Black Queen on g7**:
   - Queens can move along ranks, files, and diagonals.
   - Possible moves include g8, g6, g5, g4, g3, g2, g1 (along the g-file).
   - Diagonals: h8, h6, f8, f6, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1.
   - Ranks: h7, f7, e7, d7, c7, b7, a7.
   - Check for obstructions:
     - All squares seem open except for potential captures or blocks, but no White pieces are on these paths.
   - The queen has many possible moves, all of which appear legal.

3. **Black Rook on c2**:
   - Rooks move along ranks and files.
   - Possible moves: c1, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8 (along the c-file).
   - Along the 2nd rank: b2, a2, d2, e2, f2 (but f2 is occupied by Black's own pawn, so not possible).
   - Check for obstructions: c1 to c8 are open, a2 to e2 are open.
   - Note: Moving to d2 or e2 could potentially attack White's pieces or control key squares.

4. **Black Pawn on f2**:
   - Pawns move forward (towards rank 1 for Black).
   - Possible move: f1 (one square forward).
   - Since it's on the 2nd rank, no two-square move is possible (already moved past initial position based on standard rules).
   - Promotion: If it moves to f1, it reaches the 1st rank and must promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
   - So possible moves are f1=Q, f1=R, f1=B, f1=N.
   - All appear legal as f1 is not occupied.

I have identified multiple legal moves for Black:
- King moves: Kh5-g6, Kh5-g5, Kh5-g4, Kh5-h6, Kh5-h4.
- Queen moves: Many options like Qg7-g6, Qg7-h8, etc.
- Rook moves: Rc2-c1, Rc2-c3, etc., and along the 2nd rank like Rc2-b2.
- Pawn promotion moves: f2-f1=Q, f2-f1=R, etc.

Since the goal is to find one legal move, I can select any of these. The simplest and most straightforward might be a king move or a pawn promotion, as they are clear and don't require complex calculation. However, pawn promotion to a queen (f2-f1=Q) is a strong move as it adds a powerful piece to the board. I will choose this move for its strategic value, even though the task only requires a legal move.

I must ensure the move notation is correct. Since it's Black's turn and the move number is not specified in the FEN beyond "0 1", I will assume it's move 1 for notation purposes or simply provide the move without a number initially, but per PGN standards, I should include move numbers if possible. Given the instruction to include move numbers, I'll assume it's move 1 for Black.

Looking at the FEN, it's "0 1", which might indicate the move number isn't set, but in PGN, I need to provide it. Since it's Black to move, it must be after White's move, so I'll denote it as move 1 for simplicity.

Now, confirming the pawn promotion move: moving the pawn from f2 to f1 and promoting to a queen is written as f1=Q in PGN. I need to ensure no ambiguity, but since there's only one pawn that can move to f1, it's clear.

Thus, one legal move is f2-f1=Q.
