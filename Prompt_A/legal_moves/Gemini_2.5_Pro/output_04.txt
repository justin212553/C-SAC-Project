This is a simple endgame position. It is Black's turn to move.

**Black's Pieces and Possible Moves:**

1.  **King on b5:** The black king can move to any adjacent square that is not attacked by a white piece. The available squares are a4, a5, a6, b4, b6, c4, c5, and c6. All of these are safe and therefore legal moves.
2.  **Rook on e4:** The black rook controls the 4th rank and the e-file.
    *   It can move along the 4th rank to a4, b4, c4, d4, f4, g4, or h4.
    *   It can move along the e-file to e1, e2, e3, e5, e6, e7, or e8.

**Analysis of a Strong Move:**

A particularly strong move for Black is to check the white king. The move `Re1` places the white king in check. This forces White to respond to the check, limiting their options. The white king would have to move to f1 or h1. This move is a good example of using the initiative in the endgame.

**Conclusion:**

There are many legal moves available for Black. I will select `Re1+` as it is a forcing move (a check) and a very strong one in this position.
