This is a chess position where it is Black's turn to move.

**Piece Analysis:**

*   **Black King (a8):** The king can legally move to a7, b7, and b8. These squares are not under attack by any white piece.
*   **Black Pawn (b5):** This pawn can move one square forward to b4. The square b4 is controlled by the white king on a3, but this does not prevent a pawn from moving there (it only prevents the black king from moving there). So, `b4` is a legal move.
*   **Black Pawn (c5):** This pawn is blocked by the black pawn on c4 and has no legal moves.
*   **Black Bishop (g5):** The light-squared bishop has several legal moves along its diagonals, such as to h6, f6, e7, d8, h4, and f4.
*   **Black Pawn (c4):** This pawn can move one square forward to c3. Similar to the b-pawn, the fact that the white king controls c3 does not make the move illegal. So, `c3` is a legal move.
*   **Black Rook (h2):** The rook has many legal moves along the h-file and the 2nd rank. For example, it can move to h1, h3, g2, f2, etc. It can also deliver a check with `Rb2+`.

**Conclusion:**

The position is not a stalemate as Black has numerous legal moves available. I will select the pawn move `b4` as one possible legal move.
