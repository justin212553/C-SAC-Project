1. **White's turn to move**: The position is analyzed from White's perspective. White has the following pieces: a knight on e4, a rook on g4, and a king on g2.

2. **Legal moves for the knight (Ne4)**:
   - The knight can move to c3, d2, d6, f2, f6, or g3. All these squares are within the board and not occupied by White's pieces.

3. **Legal moves for the rook (Rg4)**:
   - The rook can move along the g-file to g3, g2, g1, or up the 4th rank to h4, f4, e4, d4, c4, b4, or a4. All these squares are valid.

4. **Legal moves for the king (Kg2)**:
   - The king can move to f2, f3, g3, or h3. All these squares are valid.

5. **Choosing one legal move**:
   - Any of the above moves is valid. For this solution, I will choose the move **Rg4-g3**, which moves the rook one square down the g-file.
