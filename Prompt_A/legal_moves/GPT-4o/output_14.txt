1. **Black to move**: Analyze all black pieces and their legal moves.
   - **Black King (c2)**: The king can move to b1, b2, c1, or d1. However, c1 and d1 are illegal due to the pawn on c1 and the edge of the board.
   - **Black Rook (e8)**: The rook can move along the e-file or the 8th rank. Possible moves include e7, e6, e5, e4, e3, e2, e1, f8, g8, and h8.
   - **Black Rook (f7)**: The rook can move along the f-file or the 7th rank. Possible moves include f6, f5, f4, f3, f2, f1, e7, g7, and h7.
   - **Black Pawn (c3)**: The pawn can move to c2 (promotion is possible).

2. **Legal move selection**: Any of the above moves are legal. For simplicity, I will choose one move: c2 (pawn promotion).

3. **Pawn promotion**: When the pawn moves to c2, it can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. The most logical choice is to promote to a queen for maximum power.
