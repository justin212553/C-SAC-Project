--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **White to move**: Analyze all possible moves for White.
   - The White pieces are: King (a4), Queen (f6), Rook (c8), and Bishop (g5).
   - The Black King is on a7, so any move that puts the Black King in check or checkmate should be prioritized.

2. **King (a4)**: The White King has no legal moves because all adjacent squares are either occupied or under attack by Black's pieces.

3. **Queen (f6)**: The Queen can move to several squares. Notable options include:
   - Capturing the Black Rook on f7 (Qxf7+), which puts the Black King in check.
   - Moving to other squares, but Qxf7+ is the most forcing move.

4. **Rook (c8)**: The Rook can move along the c-file or the 8th rank. However, none of these moves are as forcing as Qxf7+.

5. **Bishop (g5)**: The Bishop can move along its diagonals, but again, none of these moves are as forcing as Qxf7+.

6. **Conclusion**: The best move is **Qxf7+**, as it puts the Black King in check and forces a response.
