1. **Black to move**: The position is analyzed from Black's perspective. Black has three pieces: the king on f8, the queen on g7, and the bishop on g6. Each piece's legal moves will be considered.

2. **King (f8)**: The black king can move to e8, e7, f7, g7, or g8. However, g7 is occupied by the black queen, so it is not a legal move.

3. **Queen (g7)**: The black queen can move to any square along the g-file (g1–g6), the 7th rank (a7–f7, h7), or diagonals extending from g7. All these moves are legal.

4. **Bishop (g6)**: The black bishop can move along its diagonals. It can move to h5, f5, e4, d3, c2, b1, or h7. All these moves are legal.

5. **Choosing one legal move**: Since the task is to find one legal move, I will select a move for the black queen, as it has the most flexibility. For example, moving the queen to g5 is a simple and legal move.
