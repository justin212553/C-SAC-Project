--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. **White to move**: The position is analyzed from the perspective of White, as it is White's turn.
2. **Pieces on the board**:
   - White has a king on a1, pawns on c4 and c5, a bishop on g4, and a rook on h7.
   - Black has a king on a6.
3. **Legal moves**:
   - The rook on h7 can move along the h-file or the 7th rank.
   - The bishop on g4 can move diagonally.
   - The pawns on c4 and c5 can advance one square forward.
   - The king on a1 can move to b1 or b2.
4. **Goal**: Identify one legal move for White. For simplicity, I will choose a move that progresses White's position.

After evaluating the position, I choose the move **c5-c6**, advancing the pawn closer to promotion.
