--- THOUGHT PROCESS START ---

1. Analyze the position:
   - White to move.
   - White has a king on e6 and a pawn on f7.
   - Black has a king on f8.
   - The pawn on f7 is one square away from promotion.

2. Legal moves for White:
   - The pawn on f7 can move to f8 and promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This move also delivers checkmate because the Black king on f8 has no escape squares.
   - The White king on e6 has no legal moves because all adjacent squares are either occupied or under attack by the Black king.

3. Best move:
   - Promoting the pawn on f7 to a queen (f8=Q) is the optimal move, as it delivers checkmate immediately.
