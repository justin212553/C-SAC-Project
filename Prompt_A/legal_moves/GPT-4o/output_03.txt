1. White to move. Analyze all moveable pieces:
   - The white king on b4 can move to a3, a5, b3, b5, c3, or c5, provided these squares are legal and not occupied.
   - The white rook on e5 can move along the e-file or the 5th rank to any unoccupied square.

2. Evaluate legal moves:
   - The white king has six potential moves: a3, a5, b3, b5, c3, and c5. All these squares are unoccupied and within the board's boundaries, so they are legal.
   - The white rook can move to e1, e2, e3, e4, e6, e7, e8, a5, b5, c5, d5, f5, g5, or h5. All these squares are unoccupied and within the board's boundaries, so they are legal.

3. Choose one legal move:
   - For simplicity, select the move 1. Re8, where the rook moves to the 8th rank.
