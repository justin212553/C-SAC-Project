1. **White's turn**: Analyze all moveable pieces for White.
   - **King (b8)**: The king can move to a8, c8, or c7. However, c7 is occupied by a black pawn, and c8 is under attack by the black rook on c1. The only legal move is Kxa8.
   - **Rook (d1)**: The rook can move along the d-file or the 1st rank. However, all squares along the d-file are blocked, and moving along the 1st rank would place the rook in an illegal position due to the black rook on c1. No legal moves for the rook.
   - **Pawn (b7)**: The pawn can move to b8, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a legal move.
   - **Pawn (c7)**: The pawn can move to c8, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a legal move.
   - **Pawn (g7)**: The pawn can move to g8, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a legal move.
   - **Pawn (h7)**: The pawn can move to h8, promoting to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. This is a legal move.
   - **Knight (b4)**: The knight can move to a2, a6, c2, c6, or d5. All these squares are legal moves.
   - **Knight (c3)**: The knight can move to a4, b1, b5, d1, d5, or e2. All these squares are legal moves.
   - **Queen (d4)**: The queen can move along the d-file, 4th rank, or diagonals. Legal moves include d5, d6, d7, d8, e5, f6, g7, h8, c5, b6, a7, c3, b2, a1, e3, f2, g1.

2. **Goal**: Find one legal move for White. Based on the analysis above, there are multiple legal moves. Select one move to output.
