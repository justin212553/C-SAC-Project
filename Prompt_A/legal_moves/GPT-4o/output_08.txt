1. **Position Analysis**:
   - It is Black's turn to move.
   - Black has two pieces on the board: a knight on e5 and a rook on g5.
   - The knight can move in an "L" shape, while the rook can move horizontally or vertically any number of squares unless blocked.

2. **Legal Moves for the Knight**:
   - The knight on e5 can move to the following squares: d3, c4, c6, d7, f7, g6, g4, and f3.
   - However, some of these squares may be outside the board or occupied by Black's own pieces. After verifying, all these squares are valid and unoccupied.

3. **Legal Moves for the Rook**:
   - The rook on g5 can move to the following squares: g4, g3, g2, g1, g6, g7, g8, f5, e5, d5, c5, b5, and a5.
   - After verifying, all these squares are valid and unoccupied.

4. **Choosing One Move**:
   - Any of the legal moves can be chosen as the solution. For simplicity, I will select the rook move **Rg4**.
