1. **Position Analysis**:  
   - It is Black's turn to move.  
   - Black has one piece on the board: a rook on e4.  
   - The rook can move horizontally or vertically, as long as it does not move off the board or land on an occupied square.  

2. **Legal Moves for the Rook**:  
   - The rook on e4 can move to any square along the e-file (e5, e6, e7, e8, e3, e2, e1).  
   - The rook can also move horizontally along the 4th rank (d4, c4, b4, a4).  

3. **Choosing One Move**:  
   - Any of these moves is legal. For simplicity, I will select one move: **Re1** (rook moves to e1).
